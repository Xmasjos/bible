  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

      <VERS vnumber="11">Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After the Babylonian exile, Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel; Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud; Abiud was the father of Eliakim; Eliakim was the father of Azor;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So there were in all fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and fourteen generations from David to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen generations from the Babylonian exile to the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The birth of Jesus was in this way: His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, but before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Joseph, her husband, being an upright man, and yet not willing to make her a public example, resolved to dismiss her privately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But while he was thinking this over, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">All this happened in fulfillment of what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">"Behold the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and they will call his name Immanuel" <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">which means, God is with us</NOTE></DIV>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took his wife to his home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But he did not live with her as a husband until she had borne a son. He called his name Jesus.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">AFTER Jesus had been born in Bethlehem, in Judaea, in the days of Herod the King, wise men from the East arrived at Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">saying, "Where is he who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the East and have come to do homage to him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When King Herod heard it, he was disturbed, and so was all Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then he called together all the high priests and scribes of the people and inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They said to him, "In Bethlehem, in Juda. For so it was written by the prophet,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">'And thou, Bethlehem, land of Judah, art by no means least among the leaders of Judah; for from thee will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel.' "</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them exactly the time of the star's appearance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and as he sent them to Bethlehem he said, "Go and make careful inquiries about the child, and when you have found him bring me word, so that I too may come and do homage to him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After hearing the king, they journeyed on, and the star which they had seen in the East went before them until it came and stood over where the child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they saw the star, they were very joyful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They entered the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and did him homage. Then they opened their treasures and presented to him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod, and so went by another mad back to their own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph and said, "Rise up, and take the child and his mother and flee into Egypt, and be there until I tell you, for Herod will search for the child in order to kill him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So Joseph rose up, and took the child and his mother in the night and went away to Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and was there until the death of Herod, in order that the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, "Out of Egypt I called my Son."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Herod, seeing that he had been outwitted by the wise men, became furious, and sent out and killed all the boy babies two years old and under in Bethlehem and all its neighborhood, guided by the date which he had carefully learned from the wise men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet when he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted because they are not."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But after Herod had died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and said, "Arise, and take the child and his mother and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead who sought the child's life."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So he arose, and took the child and his mother and came into the land of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being directed in a dream he went away to the region of Galilee</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and settled in a town called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, "He will be called a Nazarene."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">IN those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wild part of Judaea</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and saying, "Repent; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this is he who was foretold through Isaiah the prophet when he said: 'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Make ready the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.' "</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This John had his clothing of camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judaea and all the neighborhood of the Jordan</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said, "Brood of vipers, who directed you to flee from the coming wrath?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Produce fruit fitting for a change of heart,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and do not think of saying to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you God is able out of these stones to raise up children for Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not yield good fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I baptize you with water for a change of heart, but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I; I am not worthy to carry his shoes; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He has his fan in his hand and will thoroughly clean his threshing-floor. He will gather his grain into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But John opposed him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus replied, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Permit it now, for so it is fitting for us to complete every righteous act."</STYLE> Then he permitted him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus, as soon as he was baptized, went up from the water, and the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">A voice from the heavens said, "This is my Son, the beloved in whom I delight."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THEN Jesus was led by the Spirit up into the wild country to be tempted by the Devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">After he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to turn into loaves of bread."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' "</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the Devil took him with him to the holy city and placed him on the top of the temple</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, 'To his angels he will give charge of you, and on their hands they will bear you lest you strike your foot against a stone.' "</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"It is written, too, 'Thou shalt not try the Lord thy God.' "</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Again the Devil took him with him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and said to him, "All these things I will give you if you will fall down and do homage to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Jesus said to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Begone, Satan, for it is written, 'To the Lord thy God alone shalt thou do homage, and him alone shalt thou serve.' "</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the Devil left him, and angels came and waited upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Jesus heard that John had been betrayed, he went away into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum on the lake shore on the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, road to the sea, country beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">the people that sat in darkness saw a great light and upon those sitting in the land and shadow of death light dawned."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From that time Jesus began to proclaim and say, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As he was walking along the shore of the lake of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and he said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Follow me and I will make you fishers of men."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">They at once left the nets and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Going on from there, he saw two other brothers \'97 James the son of Zebedee and John his brother \'97 in their boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They at once left the boat and their father and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus went around through the whole of Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">His fame spread out into all Syria, and they brought to him all who were sick with various diseases and those suffering from acute pain, demoniacs, lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Great crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from beyond the Jordan.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">SEEING the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he had seated himself his disciples came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">

      <VERS vnumber="2">After binding him, they led him away and handed him over to Pilate the Governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus had been condemned, was sorry and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the high priests and elders,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Then throwing the silver into the Temple he left and went and hung himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The high priests took the money and said, "It is not proper to put it in with the consecrated gifts, since it is the price of blood."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So after consultation they bought with it the potter's field for the burial of strangers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For this reason that field is called the "Field of Blood" to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then was fulfilled what was said through Jeremiah the prophet, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was priced, whom they priced from the sons of Israel,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus stood before the Governor. The Governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"I am."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">While he was being accused by the high priests and elders, he answered nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Jesus did not answer even one word, so that the Governor was much astonished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">At every feast the Governor was accustomed to release for the people one prisoner, whomever they chose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There was at that time a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So, when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he knew that out of jealousy they had handed him over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">While he was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent to him a message, "Do not have anything to do with that righteous man. For I have suffered much to-day in a dream because of him."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">When Pilate saw that he was doing no good, but rather that an uproar was arising, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd and said, "I am innocent of this blood. You will have to see to it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">All the people answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he released Barabbas for them, but scourged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the soldiers of the Governor took Jesus with them into the castle and gathered about him all the battalion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They stripped him and put on him a crimson cloak,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head, put a reed into his right hand, and, going down on their knees before him, made sport of him, shouting, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They spit on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">After they had finished making sport of him, they took off from him the crimson cloak and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucifixion.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">At the same time there were crucified along with him two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">In the same way the high priests, making sport of him, along with the scribes and elders, kept saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="50">But Jesus, after calling out again with a loud voice, gave up his spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">All the land of Judaea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him and were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">John's clothes were of camel's hair and he had a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">He did not permit any one to accompany him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">When they approached the Director's house, they saw a noisy crowd weeping loudly and wailing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He entered and said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Why are you making so much noise and weeping so? The child is not dead, but is sleeping."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But they laughed at him. Then he put them all out and took the child's father and mother and his own companions and went in where the child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Taking hold of the child's hand he said to her, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Talitha koum,"</STYLE> which means, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Little girl, rise up."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Immediately the little girl rose up and walked around. She was twelve years old. They were utterly amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But he strictly ordered that no one should know it, and told them to give her something to eat.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">LEAVING there, he came to his own native place accompanied by his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When the Sabbath came, he began teaching in the synagogue. Many who heard were astonished and said, "Where did he get this, and what is this wisdom with which he is gifted? How are such deeds of power done by his hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?" So they fell into mistake regarding him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Jesus said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"A prophet is not without honor except in his own native place and among his own kindred and in his own home."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There he was unable to do any work of power, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Their lack of faith astonished him. He made a circuit through the villages, teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then he called together the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over impure spirits,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and instructed them not to take anything for their journey but just a stick; no bread, no bag, no coppers in their belts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">to be shod with sandals, and not to have two tunics.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">
        <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Wherever the people will not receive you or listen to you, when you leave shake off the dust that is under your feet as a testimony against them."</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They went out and proclaimed that men should repent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many sick people and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The name of Jesus was so much talked about that King Herod heard of it. Some were saying, "John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these mighty works are done by him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Others said, "It is Elijah," and others said, "It is a prophet like one of the old prophets."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Herod, when he heard about him, said, "John, the man whom I beheaded, has risen again."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For John had said to Herod, "It is not right for you to have your brother's wife."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Herodias hated him and wished to kill him, but was unable to do so,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">because Herod reverenced John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he protected him. When Herod heard John, he was much perplexed, and yet he was glad to listen to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But an opportunity came for Herodias when Herod, on his birthday, gave a feast to his high officials and military officers and the leading men of Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then the daughter of Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and his guests. The King said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you will and I will give it to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He swore, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to the half of my kingdom."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The girl went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" She replied, "The head of John the Baptizer."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The girl immediately hurried in and said to the King, "I choose to have you give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">This made the King very sorry, but on account of his oaths and his guests he was unwilling to refuse her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So he immediately sent one of the guardsmen with orders to bring John's head. The soldier went and beheaded him in the prison</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and brought the head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">When John's disciples heard about it, they came and took the body and laid it in a tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The apostles gathered back to Jesus and reported to him all that they had done and all that they had taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Come away alone into some solitary place and rest a little."</STYLE> For there were many people coming and going, and they had no time even to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So they put off in a boat for an uninhabited, solitary place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But many saw them going and recognized them, and ran together by land from all the towns and got there before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">When Jesus landed, he saw a great crowd, and he was filled with compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began and taught them many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">By this time it was late in the day, and his disciples came to him and said, "This is an uninhabited place and the hour is already late.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Send them away so that they can go to the farms and villages around and buy themselves something to eat."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Give them something to eat yourselves."</STYLE> They said, "Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings worth of bread and feed them?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He asked, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"How many loaves have you? Go and see."</STYLE> When they had ascertained they said, "Five, and there are two fishes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then he told them to have all the people recline in groups on the green grass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They lay down in rows by hundreds and by fifties.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked up to heaven and blessed them, and broke them and gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. The two fishes he also divided among all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">All ate and had abundance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">and they picked up twelve basketfuls of the broken pieces of the bread, besides portions of the fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">There were five thousand men who ate of the loaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Jesus immediately had his disciples get into the boat and cross before him to Bethsaida while he was dismissing the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">After taking leave of them, he went away up the mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When evening had fallen, the boat was half across the lake and he was alone on the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">He saw them distressed in rowing, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night, he came to them walking on the lake and he seemed to be going past them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought that it was a ghost and cried out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">For they all saw him and were frightened. But he immediately spoke to them and said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Then he got into the boat with them and the wind dropped. They were in boundless amazement;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">for they had not grasped the miracle of the loaves because their minds were dull.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">When they had crossed to the land they came to Gennesaret and dropped anchor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">and hurried over all that region and brought in the sick on pallets wherever they heard that he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Whenever he went into villages or towns or among the farms they would lay the sick in the streets and beg him to let them touch at least the tassel of his cloak. And all who touched were healed.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">ONCE the Pharisees gathered about him with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and they saw that some of his disciples were eating bread with "common," that is, unwashed, hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the Pharisees and all the Jews never eat without first washing their hands up to the wrist, holding faithfully to the tradition of their forefathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and when they return from market they do not eat until they have washed. There are also many other traditions which they have been taught to hold tenaciously, such as washing cups and pitchers and copper vessels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The Pharisees and scribes asked him, "Why do not your disciples live according to the tradition of our fore-fathers? Why do they eat their bread with common hands?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He replied, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites when he wrote: 'This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;</STYLE></VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">All who received him \'97 to them he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">who were born not of blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The Word became flesh and tented among us, and we looked upon his glory, glory as of an only son from a father, full of grace and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">John bore witness to him and cried, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has become before me, for he was before me.' "</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">No one has ever seen God; God the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has interpreted him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This is the testimony of John when the Jews of Jerusalem sent to him priests and Levites to ask him, "Who are you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He confessed and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the prophet?" He answered, "No."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They said then, "Who are you? Let us have an answer to give to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, "I am 'the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord,' as Isaiah the prophet said."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The men had been sent from the Pharisees.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered them, "I baptize with water. In the midst of you stands one whom you do not know \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">the One who is coming after me \'97 for whom I am not worthy to loosen the strap of his sandal."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">This happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who has become before me, for he was before me.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I did not know him, but I knew that he was to be shown to Israel. For that reason I came baptizing with water."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">John bore witness, "I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and it remained on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water \'97 he said to me, 'He on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining, that is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And I saw it and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Again on the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">and, looking at Jesus as he walked, he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The two disciples heard him say this and they followed Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="39">He said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Come and see."</STYLE> So they came and saw where he was staying, and stayed with him that day. It was then about four in the afternoon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two that heard about Jesus from John and followed him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law and of whom the prophets wrote \'97 Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Nathanael said to him, "From Nazareth can there be anything good?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"See, here is a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Because I said to you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than this."</STYLE></VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">ON the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Then he said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Dip out now and carry it to the Master of the feast."</STYLE> They carried it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and when the Master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine, not knowing where it came from \'97 though the servants who had dipped out the water knew \'97 he called to the bridegroom</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana in Galilee and displayed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this Jesus went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and there they stayed a few days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for thy house will devour me."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">The Jews said, "It took forty-six years to build this Temple, and will you raise it in three days?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he was speaking of the temple of his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So when he arose from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When he was in Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover, many believed in his name, seeing his signs that he did,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">WHEN Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples across the brook Kidron to a place where there was a garden. Into this he entered with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Judas who was betraying him knew the place, for Jesus often met with his disciples there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Judas, getting a battalion of soldiers and some subordinate officers of the high priests and the Pharisees, came there with torches and lamps and weapons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus, knowing all things that were coming upon him, came forward and said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Whom are you seeking?"</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They answered him, "Jesus the Nazarene." He said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"I am he."</STYLE> Judas the traitor was standing with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When he said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"I am he,"</STYLE> they moved backward and fell to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Again he questioned them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Whom are you seeking?"</STYLE> They said, "Jesus the Nazarene."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"I have told you that I am he. If then you are seeking for me, let these go."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">He said this that the word might be fulfilled which he had spoken, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Of those whom thou hast given me I have lost none."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck a servant of the High Priest, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus said to Peter, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Put your sword into its sheath. The cup that my Father has given me \'97 shall I not drink it?"</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the battalion and the Tribune and the Jewish policemen arrested Jesus and bound him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and took him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was High Priest that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Caiaphas was the man who had advised the Jews that it was best that one man should die for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Simon Peter was following Jesus and so was another disciple. That disciple was known to the High Priest and he went in with Jesus into the court of the High Priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Peter stood by the gate outside. The other disciple, who was known to the High Priest, went out and spoke to the girl at the door and brought in Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The girl at the door said to Peter, "You are not one of this man's disciples, too, are you?" He said, "I am not."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The servants and policemen were standing there. They had made a fire, for it was cold, and were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The High Priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"I have spoken frankly to the world. I constantly taught in synagogues and in the Temple courts where all the Jews assemble, and I have spoken nothing in secret.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">
        <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Why do you question me? Question my hearers what I said to them. Certainly they know what I said."</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When he said this, a policeman, who was standing by, gave Jesus a slap, saying, "Do you answer the High Priest that way?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Jesus answered him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness against me of the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?"</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, "Are not you also one of his disciples?" He denied it and said, "I am not."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">One of the servants of the High Priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Did I not see you in the garden with him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Again Peter denied, and immediately a cock crowed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">They led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Castle. It was early morning. The Jews did not enter the Castle, wishing to avoid defilement, so that they might eat the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Pilate went out to them and said, "What charge do you bring against this man?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They answered, "If he were not an evil-doer, we should not have handed him over to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your law." The Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put any one to death."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">They said this that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled \'97 the word he had spoken indicating by what death he was to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Pilate entered the Castle again and called Jesus and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Do you say this of yourself or did others tell you about me?"</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate answered, "I am not a Jew, am I? Your nation and the high priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my subordinates would be fighting to prevent my being delivered up to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Pilate said to him, "Are you not a king then?" Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"I am a king, as you say. For this I was born and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth listens to my voice."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" After saying this he went out again to the Jews and said to them, "I find no crime in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But you have a custom that I should release for you one at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Barabbas was a robber.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THEN Pilate took Jesus and scourged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and placed it on his head, threw around him a purple cloak,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and kept coming up to him and saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and slapping him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Pilate went out again and said to them, "See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no crime in him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak. Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the high priests and their subordinates saw him, they shouted, "Crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate said, "You take him and crucify him. For I find no crime in him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Jews answered, "We have a law and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Pilate heard that, he was more alarmed</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and went into the Castle and said to Jesus, "Where do you come from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Pilate said to him, "Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"You would not have any authority over me if it were not given you from above. For this reason he who delivered me to you has a greater sin."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this, Pilate kept trying to release him, but the Jews shouted, "If you let this man go you are not a friend of Caesar. Every one who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Pilate, on hearing these words, brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat in the place called the Mosaic Pavement \'97 in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">It was the Preparation Day of the Passover, about noon. He said to the Jews, "See your king!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They shouted, "Away with him, away with him! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your king?" The high priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and laid on him his cross and went out to what is called Skull Place \'97 in Hebrew, Golgotha \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">where they crucified him. And with him they crucified two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus between them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Pilate wrote a sign and put it up on the cross. It was written: <STYLE css="font-weight:bold">JESUS THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The high priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'This man said, I am King of the Jews.' "</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothes and made four parts, a part to each soldier, and there was his tunic besides. The tunic was seamless, woven from the top entire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots who shall have it." This was so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "They parted my garments among them and on my clothing they cast lots." The soldiers did this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">There were standing beside the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Woman, there is your son."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to the disciple, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"There is your mother."</STYLE> From that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this, Jesus knowing that now all things had been completed, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"I am thirsty."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">A pitcher was standing there full of sour wine. Putting a sponge full of sour wine on a hyssop stem, they raised it to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When Jesus had taken the sour wine, he said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"It is finished,"</STYLE> and bowing his head gave up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews, because it was Preparation Day, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for that Sabbath was a great day, requested Pilate to have their legs broken to kill them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But, coming to Jesus, when they saw him already dead, they did not break his legs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But one of the soldiers with his spear pierced his side and immediately there came forth blood and water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He who saw it has borne witness and his witness is true, and he knows that he speaks the truth in order that you may believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For this happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "A bone of him shall not be broken."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And again another Scripture says, "They will look on him whom they have pierced."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate permission to carry away the body of Jesus, and Pilate granted it. So he came and carried his body away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Nicodemus, the man who came to him at first by night, came also bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the custom of the Jews in preparing for burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There was in the place where he had been crucified a garden and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had been laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">There, on account of the Preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">ON the first day of the week, early in the morning while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been taken from the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">She ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken away the Master from the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter and the other disciple went out and made their way to the tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They were both running, and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and stooping he saw the linen cloths lying; but he did not enter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Simon Peter came following him and entered the tomb and looked at the linen cloths lying</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and the handkerchief that had been about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place apart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the other disciple who had come first to the tomb entered, and he saw and believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they did not yet know the Scripture that he must rise from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the disciples went back to where they were staying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Mary was standing by the tomb outside weeping. As she wept she stooped and looked into the tomb</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and saw two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have carried away my Master and I do not know where they have laid him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">After saying this, she turned and saw Jesus standing, but did not recognize that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus said to her, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?"</STYLE> She, thinking that he was the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you have removed him, tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus said to her, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Mary!"</STYLE> She turned and said to him in Hebrew, "Rabboni!" <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">that is, Teacher</NOTE></DIV>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Jesus said to her, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brethren and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'</STYLE></VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">In the evening of that day, the first day of the week, when the doors had been closed where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Peace be with you."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy on seeing the Master.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">AFTER this, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Lake of Tiberias. He showed himself in this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There were together Simon Peter and Thomas, called Didymus <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">the Twin</NOTE></DIV>, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee and two other disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They said, "We will go along with you." They went out and got into a boat, but that night they caught nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach. The disciples, however, did not recognize that it was Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Children, have you anything to eat?"</STYLE> They answered him, "No."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Master!" Simon Peter, on hearing that it was the Master, girded around him his blouse, for he was naked, and threw himself into the lake.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Observing the fearless outspokenness of Peter and John and perceiving that they were common, uneducated men, they were astonished, and they recognized them as former companions of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Seeing the man who had been healed standing there with the apostles, they had nothing to say in opposition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">After ordering them to go out of the council, they conferred together,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">They were persuaded by him. So they called in the apostles and gave them a flogging and ordered them not to go on speaking in the name of Jesus, and then set them at liberty;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Then he came out from the land of the Chaldaeans and settled in Haran. From there, after the death of his father, God removed him into this land in which you now live,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">God spoke thus, 'His descendants will sojourn in a land not their own, and they will be enslaved and maltreated four hundred years.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And God said, 'That nation by which they are enslaved I will judge, and after that they shall come out and serve me in this place.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham circumcised his son Isaac on the eighth day, and Isaac circumcised his son Jacob, and Jacob circumcised his sons, the twelve patriarchs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">"The patriarchs becoming jealous of Joseph sold him into Egypt. But God was with him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and delivered him out of all his trials, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him governor over the land of Egypt and all his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great distress, and our fathers found no food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt he sent our fathers the first time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family was made known to Pharaoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Joseph sent and invited down Jacob his father and all his relatives, seventy-five persons,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">He thought that his brethren knew that God would give them freedom through his hand. But they did not understand it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">On the next day Moses appeared when two of them were fighting, and tried to make peace between them, saying, 'Men, you are brethren. Why are you injuring each other?'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">SAUL also approved of their putting him to death. On that day arose a great persecution of the church in Jerusalem. All except the apostles were scattered through Judaea and Samaria.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Saul cruelly hounded the church from house to house, entering and dragging out men and women and handing them over into prison.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">The crowds with one mind gave attention to what was said by Philip, listening to his words and seeing the signs that he did.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">There was great rejoicing in that city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A certain man named Simon had previously been practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">This happened a third time, and then immediately the sheet was taken up into the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Peter was thinking this over and was at a loss what the vision meant. Just then the men who had been sent by Cornelius, after inquiring for the house of Simon, came to the door</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Conversing with him Peter entered the house and found many people assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He said to them, "You understand that it is against our Law for a Jew to be closely associated with a Gentile or to visit him. But God has taught me not to call any person common or unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore when I was sent for I came without making any objection. So now I ask, For what reason have you sent for me?"</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">you know the story that spread through all Judaea. It began in Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="43">All of the prophets testify to this, that every one who believes in him obtains forgiveness of sins through his name."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">While Peter was speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to his message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">All the believers who were of the circumcision who had come along with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the Gentiles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">for they heard them speaking with tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter said,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="48">And he directed that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain there a few days.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">THE apostles and the brethren throughout Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the message of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision criticized him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">saying, "You went into the houses of uncircumcised men and ate with them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Peter began and explained consecutively all that had happened. He said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"I was in the city of Joppa and was praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. Something like a great sheet was descending, lowered from heaven by the four corners, and it came to where I was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I looked at it attentively and saw the fourfooted animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the reptiles and the birds of the air.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I heard a voice saying to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Rise, Peter, kill and eat.'</STYLE></VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Immediately three men came to the house in which we were. They had been sent from Caesarea to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The Spirit directed me to go with them without any questioning. These six brethren also went with me, and we entered the man's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He related to us how he had seen in his house an angel who stood and said, 'Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He will speak to you words by which you and your whole household will be saved.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When I began speaking the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as on us at the beginning,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and I remembered the words of the Lord how he said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If then God gave to them the same gift that he gave to us on believing in the Lord Jesus, who was I that I could oppose God?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">On hearing this they ceased their criticism and gave glory to God, saying, "Then even to the Gentiles God has granted the change of heart that leads to life."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Those who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message to none but Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, and they on reaching Antioch spoke also to the Greeks, telling them the good news of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number believed and turned to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Word came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem regarding these men, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When he arrived and saw the grace of God he was delighted, and he encouraged all to be firmly faithful to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. A considerable number were added to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Barnabas went away to Tarsus to look up Saul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and upon finding him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a large company, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called "Christians."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">In those days some prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">One of them named Agabus arose and foretold through the Holy Spirit that a great famine was going to occur over all the inhabited world. <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">It happened in the time of Claudius.</NOTE></DIV></VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">ABOUT that time King Herod laid hands on some members of the church in order to maltreat them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He killed James the brother of John with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the Days of Unleavened Bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He seized him and put him in prison, committing him to four guards of four soldiers each for safe keeping, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So Peter was under guard in the prison. But prayer was continually made by the church to God for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">On the very night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains, and guards before the door were watching the prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Suddenly an angel of the Lord was there. Light shone in the cell. Striking Peter's side he woke him, saying, "Rise up quickly." His chains fell off his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The angel said to him, "Put on your belt and your sandals." Peter did so. The angel said to him, "Throw your cloak around you and follow me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Peter came out and followed along, not knowing whether what the angel was doing was real. He thought he was seeing a vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">After passing the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city. This opened for them of its own accord and they went out and went along one street. Then suddenly the angel left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I know truly that the Lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hands of Herod, and from all the expectation of the Jewish people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So understanding the situation, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John called Mark, where a number were assembled and were praying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Peter knocked at the door of the entry, a girl named Rhoda came to listen,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and when she recognized Peter's voice, without opening the door, she ran for joy and told them that Peter was standing at the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They said to her, "You are insane." But she was positive that it was so. They said, "It is his angel."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Peter continued knocking. When they opened the door and saw him they were amazed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He motioned to them with his hand to be silent, and explained to them how the Lord had delivered him out of the prison, and he said, "Tell this to James and the brethren." Then he left and went to a different place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When day came there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Herod searched for him, but not finding him he closely questioned the guards and ordered them to be led away to execution. Then he went down from Jerusalem to Caesarea and stayed there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Herod had a bitter feud with the Tyrians and Sidonians. But they came to him with one mind, and having won over Blastus, the King's chamberlain, they begged for peace, because their country depended for its food supply on the King's country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">On an appointed day Herod in his royal robes sat on a platform and made an address to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The people shouted, "It is a god's voice, not a man's."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give the glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and expired.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">As they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then, after fasting and praying and laying their hands upon them, they sent them off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Sent out in this way by the Holy Spirit, Barnabas and Saul went down to Seleucia and from there sailed for Cyprus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Arriving at Salamis they announced God's message in the synagogues of the Jews. They had John as their assistant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After passing through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came across a Jewish magician and false prophet, named Bar-Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">who was in the company of the Proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. The Proconsul invited in Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear God's message.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">The whole assembly remained silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When they ceased speaking, James said, "Brethren, listen to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Symeon has told how first God graciously visited the Gentiles and took a people for his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">With this the words of the prophets agree, as it is written,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">'After this I will return and build up again the tent of David which has fallen down; yes, I will build up its ruins and erect it again,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles upon whom my name has been bestowed, says the Lord</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who does these things foreknown from of old.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore I judge best not to trouble those of the Gentiles who have turned to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but to write to them to abstain from contamination with idols, and from unchastity, and from what has been strangled, and from blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For Moses has had for generations past in every city those who preach him, for he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to select men from themselves and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, men esteemed among the brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They wrote and sent by their hands the following letter: "The Apostles and the Brethren who are elders, to the Brethren from the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: Greeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">"Inasmuch as we have heard that certain persons from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, \'97 men whom we did not authorize, \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">it seemed good, after unanimous agreement, to select some men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">who have exposed their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will tell you orally the same things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no further burden than these necessary things:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from strangled things, and from unchastity. If you keep yourselves from these you will do well. Farewell."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So they were sent away and went down to Antioch, where they called together the whole body and delivered over the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">On reading it they rejoiced over the encouragement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Both Judas and Silas, being themselves prophets, encouraged and confirmed the brethren by long addresses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">After spending some time they were sent away with a message of peace from the brethren to those who had sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">

      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Paul and Barnabas stayed on in Antioch teaching and telling, in association with many others, the good news of the Lord's message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">After some time Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the brethren in every city in which we made known the Lord's message, and see how they are prospering."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Barnabas wished to take along John who was called Mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Paul did not approve of taking him along, since he had left them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them into the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Such a difference of feeling resulted that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Paul selected Silas and left, after being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">They went through Syria and Cilicia strengthening the churches.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THEY came to Derbe and Lystra. At Lystra there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman, who was a believer, and of a Greek father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He had a good reputation among the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul wished to have Timothy go with him. So he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts. For they all knew that his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thus they traveled through the cities and delivered to the disciples for observance the rules that had been decided on by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So the churches grew firmer in faith and increased in numbers from day to day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They went through Phrygia and the Galatian country, the Holy Spirit having prevented their speaking the message in Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Upon reaching Mysia they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the spirit of Jesus did not allow them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Passing by Mysia they came down to Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There a vision appeared to Paul in the night \'97 a Macedonian man was standing and begging him saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">After Paul had seen the vision, we at once tried to go out to Macedonia, inferring that God had called on us to tell the good news to the people there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Sailing away from Troas we made a straight run to Samothrace, and on the next day to Neapolis.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">From there we went to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia and is a Roman colony. We remained in that city for a number of days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">On the Sabbath day we went outside of the gate to a place on the riverside where it was customary to go for prayer, and we sat down and talked with the women who had gathered there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">One woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple, from the city of Thyatira, who reverenced God, was listening. God opened her heart to receive what was said by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When she had been baptized along with her household, she begged us, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay," and she insisted on our doing so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It so happened that as we were going to the place of prayer a certain slave girl who had a spirit of divination met us. She was bringing great gain to her masters by divining.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">She followed Paul and us and kept calling out, "These men are servants of God Most High, and they are teaching you the way of salvation."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This she kept doing for many days. Paul was annoyed, and turning he said to the spirit, "I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her," and it came out at that very moment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them into the public square before the authorities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Bringing them in, they said to the magistrates, "These men, who are Jews, are disturbing our city</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and teaching customs which it is not proper for us, who are Romans, to receive or practice."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The crowd joined in the attack upon them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten with rods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">After laying many stripes upon them they cast them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them securely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He on receiving such an order thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet secure in the stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. Immediately all the doors were opened and every one's fetters were loosed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The jailer, waking from sleep and seeing the doors of the prison open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Paul said with a loud voice, "Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Calling for a light he sprang in and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and led them out and said, "Men, what must I do to be saved?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, and your household,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">and they told the message of God to him and to all who were in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He took them at that hour of the night and washed their stripes. Then he was baptized, he and all of his household, immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He brought them into his house and spread the table for them, and rejoiced with his whole family because he had believed in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When morning came the magistrates sent their orderlies to say, "Set those men at liberty."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">The jailer told this order to Paul, "The magistrates have sent to have you set at liberty. Now go out and proceed on your journey in peace."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said to them, "After beating us publicly and without a trial, although we are Romans, they cast us into prison. And are they now sending us out secretly? No, let them come themselves and lead us out."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The orderlies reported these words to the magistrates. When they heard that they were Romans they were alarmed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and came and begged them, and after leading them out requested them to leave the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">They came out of the prison and went into Lydia's house, and after seeing and encouraging the brethren they departed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">AFTER passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica. Here there was a synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">According to Paul's custom he went in to meet with them, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">explaining and showing that it was necessary that the Christ should suffer and rise from the dead, and saying, "Jesus of whom I am telling you is the Christ."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Some of them were persuaded and attached themselves to Paul and Silas \'97 a large number of the pious Greeks and not a few of the leading women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the Jews became excited and, taking with them some of the base loafers from the market-place, they made a mob and threw the city into confusion. They attacked the house of Jason and tried to bring Paul and Silas out to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the magistrates, shouting, "These men who have upset the world have now come here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jason has received them. They all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is a different king \'97 Jesus."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Both the crowd and the magistrates were disturbed on hearing this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So they took security from Jason and the rest and then dismissed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The brethren immediately sent off Paul and Silas in the night to Beraea. They on arrival went into the synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">These people were nobler than those in Thessalonica. They welcomed the message with all readiness and examined the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Consequently many of them believed, and also not a few Greeks; women of high standing and men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When the Jews of Thessalonica learned that God's message had been proclaimed by Paul also in Beraea, they came there agitating and disturbing the crowds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">At once then the brethren sent away Paul to go down to the sea coast. Silas and Timothy remained there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Those who were conducting Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a letter to Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred within him as he looked upon the city full of idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He often debated in the synagogue with the Jews and pious persons, and in the market-place every day with whoever happened to be there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him, and some said, "What can this idle talker mean?" Others said, "He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods," because he was telling the good news of Jesus and the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They took him and led him up on to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new doctrine that you are speaking of is?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For you are bringing strange and surprising things to our ears. We wish to know what these things are."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For all the Athenians and the foreigners residing there spent their time in nothing else than in telling or hearing something newer than the last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Paul took his stand in the midst of the Areopagus and said: "Men of Athens, I see that you are in every way unusually reverential to the gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For in passing about and contemplating your sacred objects I came upon an altar on which was inscribed, 'To an unknown God.' What you are worshiping in ignorance \'97 that I am making known to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">"The God who made the world and all the things that are in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">nor is he served by human hands, as if he needed anything. For he gives to all life and breath and all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having marked out the appointed times and the boundaries of their abodes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">that they might seek for God, if they could feel after him and find him, though, indeed, he is not far from each one of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For in him we live and move and are; as some of your own poets have said, 'For we also are his offspring.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that deity is like gold or silver or stone, a thing carved by man's art and thought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all men everywhere to change,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">since he has set a day in which he will soon judge the world in justice by the man whom he has appointed, and of whom he has given evidence to all men by raising him from the dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some sneered; others said, "We will hear you again about this."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Paul went out from the midst of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But certain men attached themselves to him and believed. Among them was Dionysius the Areopagite, and there was a woman named Damaris and several other persons.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">AFTER this Paul left Athens and came to Corinth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There he found a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus but recently come from Italy with Priscilla his wife, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul visited these people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and because he was of the same trade stayed with them and they worked together; for by trade they were tent-makers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But in the synagogue every Sabbath he reasoned and endeavored to persuade both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was absorbed by the message, bearing witness to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When they resisted and spoke profane words, he rent his garments and said to them, "Your blood is on your own heads. I am clear, and from now on I am going to the Gentiles."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So he changed over from there and came into the house of a man named Titus Justus, who reverenced God. His house was next to the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Crispus, the synagogue Director, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard believed and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord spoke in the night by a vision to Paul, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Do not fear, but speak and be not silent,</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">
        <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">for I am with you and no one shall attack and harm you, for I have many people in this city."</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So he stayed a year and six months, teaching among them the message of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">While Gallio was Proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one mind made an attack on Paul and brought him before the court,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">saying, "This man is inducing men to worship God in a way contrary to law."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it was some crime or wicked knavery, O you Jews, I would have reasonable patience with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if it is a dispute about doctrine and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I will not be a judge of these things,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and he drove them from before the judge's seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then they laid hold of Sosthenes, the synagogue Director, and beat him right in front of the judge's seat. But Gallio cared for none of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Paul remained a number of days more. Then after taking leave of the brethren he sailed away to Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila went with him. He had shaved his head at Cenchreae, for he had a vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They came to Ephesus and Paul left his companions there. He himself went into the synagogue and debated with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Although they begged him to stay longer, he did not consent,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but took his leave, saying, "I will return to you again, God willing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">From Ephesus he put to sea and came to Caesarea. Then he went up <STYLE css="font-style:italic">to Jerusalem</STYLE> and greeted the church, and from there returned to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">After spending some time there he set out and went through the Galatian country and Phrygia, place by place, strengthening all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">A certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, a learned man, had come to Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He was strong in knowledge of the Scriptures and had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and, being very earnest in spirit, was teaching accurately about Jesus, although he knew no baptism but John's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">This man began to speak fearlessly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">As he wished to cross over to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. So he went and greatly helped those who had believed through grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he powerfully and publicly refuted the Jews, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">WHILE Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, after passing through the upper country, came to Ephesus and found certain disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They said to him, "On the contrary, we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He said, "How then were you baptized?" They said, "With John's baptism."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of a change of heart, telling the people to believe in one who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">On hearing that, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and when Paul laid his hands on them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There were about twelve of these men in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For three months Paul went into the synagogue and spoke fearlessly, arguing persuasively regarding the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When some were hardened and would not believe and spoke evil of the Way before the congregation, he departed from them and took away his disciples and discussed daily in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This went on for two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the message of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Through the hands of Paul, God did miracles of no ordinary kind,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his body were carried to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then some of the wandering Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">There were seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish high priest, who did this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know and Paul I know; but who are you?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on them and overpowered both of them, and so belabored them that they fled from that house naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This became known to all who were living in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and awe fell on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus came to be held in high honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Many of those who had become believers came confessing and telling of their practices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">A number of those who had practiced magic brought their books and burned them before all. Adding up the prices of them they found the total to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thus vigorously the Lord's message grew and strengthened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When these things had been accomplished Paul took it in mind to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there I must see Rome also."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He sent on into Macedonia two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself remained awhile in Asia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">At that time there arose no small commotion about the Way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, a maker of silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing to the artisans no small gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He gathered these and the workmen employed about such things and said, "Men, you know that from this business we get our wealth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but also throughout almost all Asia this Paul has persuaded and drawn away a large number, saying that hand-made gods are not gods at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Not only is this trade of ours in danger of coming into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis is in danger of being held of no account, and she whom now all Asia and the wide world worship will be deposed from her majesty."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Upon hearing this, they became full of anger and shouted, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The city was filled with confusion, and the people rushed with one mind into the theater, having gotten hold of Gaius and Aristarchus, fellow travelers of Paul's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When Paul wished to go in and face the people the disciples would not let him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Some of the city officials who were his friends sent to him and begged him not to expose himself in the theater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and the most did not know why they had come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Some of the crowd fixed on Alexander, since the Jews were putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand and wished to make a defense before the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when they recognized that he was a Jew, there arose one shout from all for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then the City Clerk quieted the crowd and said, "Men of Ephesus, who is there of all men who does not know that the city of Ephesus is the temple-keeper of the great Artemis, and of her image which fell down from Zeus?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Since these things are indisputable, you ought to be calm and do nothing rash.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For you have brought here these men who are not robbers of temples nor defamers of your goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">If Demetrius and the artisans with him have a charge against any one, there are court days and there are proconsuls; let the parties state their cases.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">If you are seeking anything further, it shall be settled in a lawful assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For we are in danger of being called in question regarding to-day's mob, and we shall not be able to give a reason for this tumult."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">By saying this he dissolved the gathering.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">WHEN the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and, after encouraging them, he bade them farewell and left to proceed to Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Passing through those parts and encouraging them by many addresses, he came into Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">There he spent three months. When a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There were in company with him Sopater of Beraea, the son of Pyrrhus, and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy, and from Asia Tychicus and Trophimus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">These went on and were waiting for us in Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After the Days of Unleavened Bread we sailed from Philippi and came to them in Troas in five days. There we spent seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">On the first day of the week, when we all were assembled to break bread, Paul was discoursing to them, being about to leave in the morning, and he extended his address until midnight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">There were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A certain young man named Eutychus, sitting in a window, was overcome with deep sleep while Paul went on discoursing. At last overpowered by sleep he fell from the third story and was taken up dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul went down and threw himself on him and embraced him and said, "Do not make a noisy wailing; for his life is still in him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then he went up and broke bread and ate and talked on till daybreak and so departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They brought the boy living, and were not a little comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We went in advance to the ship and sailed for Assos, intending to take on Paul there, for so he had arranged, intending to come himself by land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So when he joined us at Assos, we took him aboard and came to Mitylene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">From there we sailed next day and arrived off Chios. The next day we came to Samos, and on the following day to Miletus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus in order not to spend time in Asia. He was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When they came to him, he said to them, "You know how I have lived among you the whole time since the first day I set foot in Asia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that befell me through the plots of the Jews \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">how I did not shrink from telling you anything that was profitable or from teaching you publicly and from house to house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">urging upon both Jews and Greeks the need of a change of heart toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">"And now I am on my way, bound in spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing what is to befall me there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">except that the Holy Spirit testifies from city to city that chains and trials are waiting for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But I do not hold my life as of any account if only I may finish my race and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the good news of the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And now I know that you all, among whom I have gone about heralding the kingdom, will never see my face again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore I testify to you to-day that I am clear of the blood of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For I did not shrink from telling you the whole purpose of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">"Be watchful of yourselves and of all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers. Shepherd the church of God which he bought with his own blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come among you, not sparing the flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And from among yourselves men will arise speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore watch, remembering that for three years I never ceased night nor day to exhort each one of you with tears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">"And now I commit you to the Lord and to his gracious message, which can build you up and give you the heritage among all those who have been made holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">You yourselves know that these hands provided for my needs and the needs of my companions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">In all things I showed you that so laboring we ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">After saying this he kneeled with them all and prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">All wept aloud, and falling on Paul's neck they kissed him affectionately,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">grieving especially because he had said that they would never see his face again; and they escorted him to the ship.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">WHEN we had torn ourselves away from them and had sailed, we made a straight run to Cos, then on the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There finding a ship crossing to Phoenicia we went on board and sailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left, we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to discharge her cargo.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We looked up the disciples and stayed with them seven days. They repeatedly told Paul through the Holy Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But when we had finished the days, we left and continued our journey, and they all with their wives and children escorted us until we got outside of the city. Then, after kneeling down on the beach and praying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">we tore ourselves from one another; we went aboard the ship and they went back to their homes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We made the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais. There we greeted the brethren and remained one day with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the Seven, and we stayed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Philip had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">During our stay of many days a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came to see us, and took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, 'So will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.' "</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When we heard this, both we and the residents there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Paul answered, "What are you accomplishing by weeping and breaking my heart? For I hold myself ready not only to be bound, but to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When he would not be persuaded, we stopped talking, saying, "The Lord's will be done."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">At the end of these days we packed up and went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Some of the disciples from Caesarea went up with us, taking along Mnason, a Cypriote, an old-time disciple, whose guests we were to be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When we reached Jerusalem, the brethren welcomed us cordially.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">On the next day, Paul went in with us for an interview with James, and all the elders came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">After saluting them, he related in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his service.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">After hearing him, they gave glory to God and said to Paul, "You see, brother, how many tens of thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and they are all zealous for the Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">These have heard reports that you are teaching all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to break away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children and not to observe the customs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What then? It will be generally heard that you have come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So do this that we tell you. There are among us four men who are under a vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Take these men and go through purification with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that what they have heard about you amounts to nothing, but that you yourself walk in obedience to the Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">"But as to the Gentiles that have believed, we have, after consideration, sent our decision that they shall guard themselves against what has been sacrificed to idols, and against blood, and against what has been strangled, and against unchastity."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Paul on the next day took the men, and, after purifying himself, entered the Temple courts, giving notice of the completion of the days of purification \'97 the time until a sacrifice would have been offered for each one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when the seven days were nearly completed, the Jews from Asia saw him in the Temple courts, and stirred up all the crowd and laid their hands on Paul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">shouting, "Men of Israel, help. This is the man who teaches everybody everywhere against our people and the Law and this place, and moreover, he has brought Greeks into the Temple courts and has desecrated this holy place."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul, and they thought that he had brought him into the Temple courts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The whole city was excited and the people rushed together. Seizing Paul, they drew him out of the Temple courts, and immediately the gates were closed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">As they were trying to kill him, word went up to the Tribune of the battalion that all Jerusalem was in commotion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the people. They, on seeing the Tribune and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the Tribune coming up arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Some called out one thing and some another in the crowd. Not being able to find out anything for certain on account of the confusion, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">When Paul got upon the stairs, it so happened that he was being carried by the soldiers on account of the violence of the mob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For the crowd of people was following and shouting, "Kill him!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">As he was about to enter the barracks Paul said to the Tribune, "May I say something to you?" He replied, "Can you speak Greek?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Are you then not the Egyptian who some time ago raised a sedition and led off four thousand assassins into the desert?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Paul said, "I am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you to let me talk to the people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">He gave him leave, and Paul standing on the stairs motioned with his hand to the people. There was a great silence, and, speaking loudly in Hebrew, Paul said:</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">"BRETHREN and Fathers, listen to the defense I now make to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Hearing him speaking to them in the Hebrew language, they kept all the more quiet. He continued:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel in exact knowledge of our ancestral Law, and I was zealous for God as you all are to-day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">as the High Priest and all the eldership can testify for me. From them I received letters to the brethren and was journeying to Damascus in order to bring back in chains to Jerusalem for punishment those who had gone there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It happened that as I was journeying and nearing Damascus, about noon, suddenly a great light flashed from heaven around me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I asked, 'Who is speaking?' He said to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">My companions saw the light, but did not hear the voice of him who spoke to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Rise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all that it has been appointed for you to do.'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Since I could not see, owing to the brightness of that light, my companions led me by the hand, and so I entered Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"Then a man named Ananias, a strict observer of the Law and highly esteemed by all the Jews who lived there,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">came to see me and stood by me and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight,' and I, at that moment, could see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One and to hear the voice from his mouth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">for you shall be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And now why delay? Rise, be baptized and wash away your sins, calling upon his name.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">"After I had returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the Temple courts, I fell into a trance</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and saw Jesus saying to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Hasten and depart quickly from Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I said, 'Lord, they know that I used to imprison and beat from synagogue to synagogue those who believe in thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and when the blood of Stephen thy martyr was shed I myself was standing by and approving it, and taking care of the cloaks of those who were putting him to death.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he said to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Go, for I will send you far away to Gentiles.'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They listened up to this point, but now they broke out, shouting, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! He ought never to have lived!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">While they were shouting and rending their garments and throwing dust into the air,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">the Tribune ordered him to be led into the barracks and directed that he should be examined with the lash, so that he might know for what crime they were shouting so against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the Centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and without a trial?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">On hearing that, the Centurion went to the Tribune and told him," What are you going to do? For this man is a Roman."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the Tribune came to him and said, "Tell me; are you a Roman?" He said, "Yes."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The Tribune said, "I obtained this citizenship by paying a great sum of money." Paul said, "But I was born to it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At once those who were about to examine him went away from him, and the Tribune was alarmed when he learned that he was a Roman, because he had chained him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">On the next day, wishing to know certainly why he was accused by the Jews, the Tribune loosed Paul and ordered the high priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and stood him before them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">PAUL fixed his eyes on the Council and said, "Brethren, I have conducted myself with all good conscience toward God up to this day."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The High Priest Ananias told those who stood near him to strike him on the mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Paul said to him, "God will soon strike you, you whitewashed wall. Are you sitting to judge me by the Law and yet violating the Law by ordering me to be struck?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Those who stood by said, "Are you insulting God's High Priest?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Paul said, "I did not know, brethren, that he was High Priest. It is written, 'Thou shalt not speak evil of the Ruler of thy people.' "</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Paul, perceiving that one party was of Sadducees and the other of Pharisees, shouted out in the Council, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am being tried for the hope of the resurrection of the dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">On his saying this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly became divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection nor any angel or spirit, but the Pharisees confess both.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So a great uproar arose, and some of the scribes of the party of the Pharisees arose and contended, saying, "We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When the strife was becoming violent, the Tribune, fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to go down and take him from the midst of them and bring him into the barracks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">On the following night the Lord stood beside Paul and said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">"Courage! As you have witnessed for me in Jerusalem, so you must witness in Rome."</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When it was day, the Jews made a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There were more than forty who had taken this oath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They came to the high priests and elders and said, "We have bound ourselves by an oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore you and the Council must ask the Tribune to bring him down to you, as if you were going to inquire more exactly about him, and we, before he comes near, will be ready to put him out of the way."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Paul called to him one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the Tribune, for he has something to tell him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He took him and led him to the Tribune and said, "Paul, the prisoner, called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The Tribune took him by the hand and led him aside and asked, "What is it that you have to tell me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to-morrow to the Council to inquire something more exactly about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But do not yield to them, for more than forty men of them are lying in ambush, and they have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him, and now they are ready, expecting a promise from you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The Tribune dismissed the young man after charging him; "Tell no one that you have revealed this to me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then calling to him two of the centurions he said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at nine o'clock to-night."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They were to provide animals for Paul to ride and take him safely to Felix the Governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He wrote a letter in the following form:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">"Claudius Lysias to his Excellency, Governor Felix: greeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came up with soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Wishing to find what was the charge that they had against him I took him down to their Council.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">I found him accused regarding disputed questions of their law, but of nothing deserving of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Information has come to me that there will be a plot against the man, and so I am sending him at once to you, and I have commanded his accusers to state their case against him before you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">So the soldiers, according to their orders, took Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">On the next day they let the horsemen go on with him, but they themselves returned to the barracks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The horsemen came on to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the Governor, and also placed Paul before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">He read the letter and asked of what province he was, and learned that he was from Cilicia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then he said, "I will hear what you have to say when your accusers also arrive." He gave orders that Paul should be guarded in Herod's castle.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">AFTER five days the High Priest Ananias came down with certain elders and an advocate named Tertullus, and they spoke against Paul to the Governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">When Paul had been called in, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Because we enjoy great peace through your administration and reforms are taking place for this nation through your prudence,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">we accept it always and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But not to burden you further, I beg you in your fairness to hear us briefly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">We have found this man a pest and an inciter of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a leader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">The Jews joined in the attack upon him, affirming that these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Paul answered, when the Governor nodded to him to speak, "Because I know that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I feel courage in defending myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You can ascertain that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Neither did they find me discussing with any one in the Temple courts nor making any tumultuous gatherings in the synagogues nor anywhere in the city,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">"This I do confess to you, that in the Way which they call a heresy I worship the God of our fathers, believing all things that are according to the Law and what is written in the Prophets</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Felix adjourned the case, since he was well informed regarding the Way, saying, "When Lysias the Tribune comes down, I will inquire into your matters."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He gave orders to the Centurion to guard him, but to let him have indulgence, and not to hinder any of his friends from attending to his wants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">After some days Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him regarding faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">While Paul was reasoning about righteousness and self-discipline and the judgment that is to come, Felix became alarmed and said," Go for the present. When I find a convenient time I will send for you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">At the same time he was in hopes that money would be given him by Paul and therefore he used to send for him more frequently and converse with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But at the end of two years Felix received Porcius Festus as a successor, and, wishing to do the Jews a favor, he left Paul in chains.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">FESTUS entered the province and after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">and begged as a favor that he would send for him to Jerusalem, intending to have an ambush and kill him on the road.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Festus answered that Paul was being kept in Caesarea and that he himself was going back very soon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">"Let those of you who can," he said, "go down with me, and, if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring their charges against him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After spending not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea and on the next day took his seat on the judge's bench and ordered Paul to be brought in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he had come in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and brought many serious charges, which they were unable to prove,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Festus, wishing to gain favor with the Jews, asked Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried for this before me?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's bar, where I ought to be tried. I have not harmed any Jews in anything, as you very well know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If I am in the wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not ask not to die. But if there is nothing in the accusations of these men, no one has the power to give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">When some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As they were spending a good many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the King. "There is a man here," he said, "who was left a prisoner by Felix,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">against whom when I was in Jerusalem the high priests and the elders of the Jews had much to say, asking to have him condemned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any person for punishment before the accused has his accusers face to face and has opportunity for defense against the charge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">"So they came along down here and, without making any delay, on the very next day I took my seat on the judge's bench and ordered the man to be brought in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When his accusers arose, they brought no charge of such crimes as I was expecting,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but they had some disputes with him about their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died and whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Being at a loss about a question of this kind, I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on the charges.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when Paul appealed to be kept for the examination of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Agrippa said to Festus, "I should like to hear the man myself." "To-morrow," he replied, "you shall hear him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So on the next day Agrippa came and Bernice with much display, and they entered the auditorium with the military tribunes and the principal men of the city, and at Festus' command Paul was led in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Festus said, "King Agrippa and all present here with us, you see this man against whom all the multitude of the Jews pleaded with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I understood that he had done nothing worthy of death, and when he himself had appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my Lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that after an examination I may have something to write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it seems to me unreasonable in sending a prisoner not to specify the charges against him."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">AGRIPPA said to Paul, "You are at liberty to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">"In regard to all of the things of which I am accused by Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that I am to make my defense to-day before you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">since you are especially expert in all Jewish customs and questions. Therefore I pray you to hear me patiently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">"My life from boyhood, which was from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, all Jews know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They knew me from long ago, if they were willing to testify, and that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now I stand to be tried for the hope of the promise which God made to our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">to which our twelve tribes devotedly serving God night and day hope to attain. For this hope I am accused by the Jews, O King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">"Why do all of you consider it incredible if God raises dead men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I thought with myself that I ought to do much against the name of Jesus the Nazarene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I did it in Jerusalem and many holy men I shut up in prison, getting authority from the high priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In all the synagogues and often I punished them and compelled them to say profane words. Being excessively mad against them, I pursued them even to foreign cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">"Thus engaged, as I was journeying to Damascus with authority and commission from the high priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">about midday, on the road, I saw, O King, a light above the brightness of the sun shining from heaven around me and my companions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">We all fell to the ground and I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad.'</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I said, 'Who is speaking?' He said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">

      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">After that, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but first to the people in Damascus and then to the people of Jerusalem and through all the land of Judaea and to the Gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds suitable for a change of heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">"For this reason Jews seized me in the Temple courts and tried to kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But obtaining help from God I have continued until this day witnessing to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would be,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">that the Christ would suffer and that he first, by rising from the dead, would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">While Paul was thus defending himself, Festus said loudly, "You are raving, Paul. Much learning is driving you insane."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">"I am not insane," he said, "most noble Festus, but am uttering words of truth and soberness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The King knows about this, and to him I speak with perfect frankness, for I am persuaded that not one of these things has escaped his attention, for this has not been done in a corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Agrippa said to Paul, "With little effort you are persuading me to become a Christian."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Paul said, "I would to God that whether with little or with much, not only you, but all who hear me this day, would become such as I am \'97 except for these chains."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the King rose and the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and after withdrawing they said to one another, "This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">WHEN it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they committed Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of an imperial battalion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Going on board a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to the places along the coast of Asia we put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">On the next day we reached Sidon, where Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to go to see his friends and enjoy their attentions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">After crossing the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on board of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">By slow sailing for many days we with difficulty arrived off Cnidus. Then the wind being against us, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and with difficulty got past it and came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When much time had passed and sailing was now dangerous because it was already after the Fast, Paul addressed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">"Men," he said, "I see that the voyage is going to be rough and with much loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the Centurion listened more to the sailing master and the ship owner than to what Paul said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and as the harbor was not convenient to winter in, the majority adopted the purpose of sailing away on the chance of being able to reach Phoenix and winter there. Phoenix is a harbor of Crete facing the southwest and the northwest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When the south wind blew softly, thinking that they had secured their purpose, they weighed anchor and coasted along Crete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But before long a hurricane, such as is called Euraquilo, swept down off the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When the ship was caught and unable to keep her head to the wind, we gave up and let her drive before it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Running under the lee of an island called Cauda, we contrived with difficulty to secure the small boat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When we had got it in, we used ropes to undergird the ship. Fearing that we might get stranded on the Syrtis, they lowered the sail and so drifted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So violently were we battered by the storm that on the next day they lightened the ship</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and on the third day with their own hands they threw over the ship's tackle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When for many days neither sun nor stars appeared and no small tempest lay on us, at last all hope of our being saved was being taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">After they had long gone without food, Paul stood up in the midst of them and said, "Men, you ought to have listened to me and not to have sailed away from Crete and met this rough experience and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But now I beg you to have courage, for there will be no loss of life of any of you, but only of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For this night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and said, 'Never fear, Paul! You must stand before Caesar. And now God has granted to you all the men who are sailing with you.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So cheer up, men. For I trust in God that it will be as it has been told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">We must, however, run on to a certain island."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven through the Adriatic, about midnight the sailors surmised that land was getting near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Sounding they found twenty fathoms, and after a little they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then fearing that they might run into rocky places, they cast out four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The sailors were intent on escaping from the ship and lowered the small boat into the sea under the pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">but Paul said to the Centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the small boat and let her fall off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Until day began to dawn, Paul kept urging all to take food. He said, "To-day is the fourteenth day that you have been on the watch fasting, not taking anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Therefore, I beg you, take some food. For this is for your safety. Not a hair of the head of any one of you is going to perish."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Saying this he took a loaf and gave thanks to God before all and broke it and began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then all cheered up and themselves took food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">We in the ship were in all two hundred and seventy-six souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">After eating heartily, they lightened the ship, throwing over the wheat into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">When day came they did not recognize the land, but they observed a bay with a beach. Into this they planned to run the ship if they could.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So abandoning the anchors they left them in the sea; at the same time loosening the bands of the steering oars and raising the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But falling into a place where there were cross-currents they ran the ship aground. The bow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was breaking up under the violence of the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">The soldiers' advice was to kill the prisoners for fear that some one of them might swim out and escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the Centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them back from their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to shore,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and the rest to follow, some on boards and some on things from the ship. And so all got safe to land.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">WHEN we were safe ashore, we found that the island was called Melita.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The foreign people showed us uncommon kindness. For they kindled a fire and welcomed us all because of the rain that was falling and the cold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Paul had collected a bundle of sticks and laid it on the fire, when a snake came out of the heat and fastened on his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, although he has escaped the sea, Justice does not permit to live."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He however shook off the creature into the fire and felt no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They kept watching to see him swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after watching a long time and seeing nothing amiss happen to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He welcomed us and for three days hospitably entertained us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill with fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After this happened, the rest in the island who had infirmities came also and were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They bestowed many honors on us and when we sailed they put on board supplies for our needs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">After three months we sailed in a ship that had wintered in the island. She was from Alexandria and her figure-head was the Twin Brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Landing at Syracuse we remained there three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From there we came around and got to Rhegium. After one day there, a south wind sprang up and we came on the second day to Puteoli.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Here we found brethren and were begged by them to stay seven days. And so we came to Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">From there the brethren, when they got news of us, came to meet us as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns. On seeing them Paul thanked God and took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When we reached Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier who guarded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">After three days he invited the leading men among the Jews, and when they had assembled, he said to them, "Brethren, although I had done nothing against our people or our ancestral customs, I was delivered up as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They, after investigating my case, wished to set me free because I had done nothing deserving of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I have any charge to bring against my own nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For this reason I have invited you to see me and talk with me; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I have this chain around me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They said to him, "We on our part have received no letters about you from Judaea nor has any one of the brethren come and reported or spoken anything evil of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">We think it well to hear from you what your views are; for as to this sect we know that it is everywhere spoken against."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They appointed a day for him and many came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying to the kingdom of God, trying to persuade them concerning Jesus from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from early morning until evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some were persuaded by what he said and some did not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">They dispersed, disagreeing with one another, after Paul had said one word, "Well said the Holy Spirit through Isaiah, the prophet, to your fathers,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And the natural uncircumcision if it keeps the Law will judge you who with a written code and circumcision are still a law-breaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For it is not he who is one outwardly that is a Jew, nor is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But he who is one secretly is a Jew, and circumcision is of the heart and in the spirit, not in the letter. His praise is not from men, but from God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">WHAT then is the advantage of the Jew, or what is the benefit of circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Much in every way. First, they were intrusted with the oracles of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what if some were faithless, will their faithlessness prevent the faithfulness of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Never. Let God be true, but every man a liar, as it is written, "That thou mayest be proved right in thy words and triumph when thou art judged."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous when he inflicts his wrath? <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">I am speaking humanly.</NOTE></DIV></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Never. If so how can God judge the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if the truth of God has become more abundant to his glory through my lie, why am I still condemned as a sinner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We are not going to say, as some people slanderously affirm that we say, "Let us do evil that good may come," are we? The condemnation of such people is just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? Have we an advantage? Not at all. We have already brought the charge against both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">as it is written, "There is not even one righteous;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">there is none that seeks God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? That of works? No, but by the law of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For we reason that a man is pronounced righteous by faith aside from works of law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Does God belong to the Jews only? Does he not belong also to the Gentiles? Yes, to the Gentiles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">if God is one and will pronounce the circumcision righteous by faith and the uncircumcision righteous through faith.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">WHAT then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, experienced?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if Abraham was pronounced righteous because of works, he had something to boast of. But he had nothing before God;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">To him who works, wages are credited not as by grace, but as due;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but to him who does not work, but believes in him who calls the unrighteous man righteous, his faith is credited for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Just so David speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">"Blessed are they whose lawless acts have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not charge up to him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Does this blessedness come to the circumcision, or also to the uncircumcision? For we say, "Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">How was it credited, when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of faith that he had in uncircumcision, so that he should be the father of all who believe while uncircumcised, and righteousness should be credited to them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and the father of the circumcised, that is, of those who are not only circumcised, but who walk in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham had while uncircumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">It was not through the Law that the promise came to Abraham or to his descendants that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is emptied of value and the promise is nullified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For the Law works wrath. But where there is no law, neither is there lawbreaking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore all depends on faith, that it may be of grace, and thus the promise be sure for all his descendants, not only those who are of the Law, but also those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of all of us</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Abraham, when hope was past, believed in hope so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was said to him, "So shall your descendants be";</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and without being weakened in faith he recognized his own body as dead, when he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Still he did not hesitate through want of faith in the promise of God, but was strong in faith, thus giving glory to God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and was fully confident that what God had promised he was able to perform.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore it was credited to him for righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It was not written for his sake only, that it was credited to him,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Hardly for a righteous man will any one die. For a good man some one perhaps may dare to die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But God shows his own love to us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And not only so, but we exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now obtained the reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore as through one man sin entered the world, and through sin death entered, and so death spread to all men, since all sinned \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">for down to the time of the Law sin was in the world, and yet sin is not charged where there is no law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but death reigned from Adam to Moses even over those who had not sinned like Adam, who is the type of him who was coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the gracious gift is not like the fall. For if by the fall of the one the many sinned, much more did the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abound to the many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the free gift was not like the sentence that came through one who sinned; for the sentence came from one fall for condemnation, but the free gift was that men should be called righteous in spite of many falls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For if by the fall of one man death reigned through that one, much more those who receive the abounding grace and the free gift of righteousness will reign in life through one, that is, through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As then through one fall sentence came upon all men and they were condemned; so through one righteous act the free gift came to all men so that they are pronounced righteous and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For as by the disobedience of the one man the many were set down as sinners, so by the obedience of the one the many will be set down as righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But law came in alongside that the fall might be greater; but where sin became greater grace became greater still,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">in order that as sin reigned in death grace might reign through righteousness and issue in life eternal through Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">WHAT shall we say then? Shall we remain in sin so that grace may be great?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Never. How shall we who died to sin still live in it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For if we have grown into union with him by the likeness of his death, surely we shall be united with him by the likeness of his resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For we know this, that our old-time humanity was crucified with him, in order that the sinful body might be made powerless, that we might no longer be slaves of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For one who has died has been pronounced righteous and free from sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if we died with Christ we believe that we shall live with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">knowing that Christ, after being raised from the dead, dies no more; death no more reigns over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the death that he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life that he lives, he lives to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So you must think yourselves dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you will obey its lusts,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">What then? May we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Never.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as servants intending obedience, you are the servants of the one you obey, whether of sin, resulting in death, or of obedience, resulting in righteousness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin you became obedient from the heart to the type of teaching in which you were instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">You were made free from sin and made servants to righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I am speaking humanly on account of the weakness of your human nature. As you did present your members as servants to impurity and to lawlessness to do lawlessness, so now you have presented your members as servants to righteousness for holy living.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">ARE you ignorant, brethren, for I am speaking to those who know law, that the Law rules over a person while he is living?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For a married woman is by law bound to her husband while he is living. But if the husband dies, she is freed from the law of her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore while her husband is living she is called an adulteress if she becomes another man's. But if her husband dies she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress when she becomes another man's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So, my brethren, you were made dead to the Law through the body of Christ, that you might become wedded to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For when we were in the flesh the sinful passions that arise through the Law were active in our members, so that we bore fruit to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now the Law has been made inoperative on us, since we have died to that by which we were held, so that we serve in newness of the spirit and not in oldness of the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Never. But I should not have come to know sin except through the Law. I should not have known lust if the Law had not said, "Thou shalt not lust."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Sin, taking occasion through the commandment, worked in me every lust. For apart from the Law sin is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I was living once, apart from law. But when the commandment came, sin began to live and I died,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and the commandment which meant life was found to mean death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me and by it killed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So the Law is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Did then what is good become death to me? Never. But sin, that it might appear sin, worked death in me through the good, in order that it might become beyond measure sinful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, sold under sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For what I am doing I do not understand. For not what I choose is what I practice, but what I hate, this I do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if I do what I do not choose, I agree with the law that it is right.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And now it is no longer I that do it, but the Sin that dwells in me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Has not the potter the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What if God, choosing to exhibit his wrath and to make known what he can do, bore in long patience the vessels of wrath made for destruction,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and in order to make known the richness of his glory upon the vessels of mercy which he had prepared for glory</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">called us not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">and in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they shall be called sons of the living God."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Isaiah cried aloud regarding Israel, "Though the number of the sons of Israel is as the sand of the sea, only a remnant will be saved.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Even as Isaiah predicted, "Unless the Lord of armies had left us some descendants, we should have become like Sodom and should have been made to resemble Gomorrah."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">What shall we say then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained righteousness, the righteousness of faith,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">but Israel pursuing after the Law of righteousness did not attain to the Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Why? Because they pursued it not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled over that stumbling stone,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">BRETHREN, the desire of my heart and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not an intelligent one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For, ignorant of God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they have not submitted to God's righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every believer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For Moses writes that he who does the righteousness of the Law shall live by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the righteousness of faith says, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who shall ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down \'97 "</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">or, 'Who shall descend into the abyss?' " \'97 that is, to bring up Christ from the dead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For with the heart a man believes and becomes righteous, and with the mouth he confesses and attains salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the Scripture says, "No one who believes in him will be put to shame."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For there is no difference between Jew and Greek. For there is the same Lord of all, rich toward all who call upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For "Every one who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? How shall they hear without some one to proclaim him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">How shall they proclaim him unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But have not all heard the good news? For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So then faith comes from the report and report comes through the word of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I say, it cannot be true that they have not heard, can it? On the contrary, "Their sound has gone out into all the earth and their words to the ends of the world."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I say, it cannot be that Israel did not know, can it? First Moses says, "I will excite you to jealousy by what is not a nation and by a foolish nation I will provoke you to anger."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Isaiah makes bold to say, "I was found by those who were not seeking me: I became manifest to those who were not inquiring for me."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I SAY then, can it be that God has repudiated his people? Never. For I am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">God has not repudiated his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says in the story of Elijah, how he prays to God against Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">"Lord, they have killed thy prophets: they have demolished thy altars, and I only am left and they are seeking my life."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But what was the divine response? "I have left to myself seven thousand men who have not knelt to Baal."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So at this present time there is a remnant according to a gracious selection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if it is by grace it is no longer because of works, for then grace would be no longer grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What then? Israel has not found what it is seeking, but the chosen have found it. And the rest have been made dull,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">as it is written, "God gave them a stupid spirit, eyes not for seeing and ears not for hearing until this day."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Let their eyes be darkened so as not to see, and bow down their backs always."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I say, then, have they stumbled just in order that they may fall? Never. But by their fall salvation comes to the Gentiles so as to arouse the emulation of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If their fall is the riches of the world and their loss the riches of the Gentiles, how much more will their full restoration be!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I say to you Gentiles \'97 since I am an apostle to Gentiles I glory in my office,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">do not exult over the branches. Even though you exult, it is not you who are supporting the root, but the root is supporting you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Certainly, for lack of faith they were broken off, and you are standing by faith. Do not be proud, but be afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">See the kindness and the rigor of God, toward those who fell rigor, but toward you God's kindness, if you continue in his kindness, else you too will be cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they if they do not continue in their unbelief will be grafted in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For God is able to graft them back. For if you were cut from your natural stock, a wild olive tree, and were grafted, contrary to nature, into a good olive tree, how much more will the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, that you may not be self-conceited, because stupidity in a measure has come upon Israel until the full number of Gentiles comes in,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">so they have now been disobedient in your time of mercy, that they too may now obtain mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For God has shut up all in unbelief in order that he may have mercy on all.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">PAUL called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and Sosthenes our brother,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to the Church of God in Corinth, made holy in Christ Jesus, called to be holy, with all everywhere who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I am always thanking God for you because of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that you are rich in him in everything, in readiness of speech and in all knowledge,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">so that my testimony to Christ has been confirmed among you</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and so that you are not lacking in any gift while waiting for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He will keep you strong to the end and free from reproach on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God is faithful, and it is by him that you have been called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I beg you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, all to say the same thing and not to have divisions among you, but to be united in the same mind and in the same opinion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For it has been told me regarding you, brethren, by Chloe's people, that there are dissensions among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I mean that each of you is saying, "I belong to Paul," "I belong to Apollos," "I belong to Cephas," or, "I belong to Christ."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am thankful that I baptized no one of you except Crispus and Gaius,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I baptized also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that I do not know that I baptized any one else.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the good news \'97 not in wisdom of words, that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will bring to nought the prudence of the prudent."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For when in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom did not come to know God, God was pleased to save through the foolishness of our proclamation those who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Jews ask for signs and Greeks seek for wisdom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">but we proclaim Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, to Gentiles folly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but to those who are called, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For God's foolishness is wiser than men and God's weakness is stronger than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Consider your own call, brethren, that not many wise, humanly speaking, not many powerful, not many high-born have been called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the strong,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and God has chosen the low-born things and the things of no account, the things that are not, to defeat the things that are,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">that no human being may boast in God's presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">By God's act you are in Christ Jesus, who has become to us wisdom from God and righteousness and holiness and deliverance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">so that, as it is written, "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">AND I in coming to you, brethren, did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I determined to know nothing among you but Jesus Christ \'97 and him crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but with spiritual and powerful proof,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that your faith might not depend on the wisdom of man but on the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We do speak wisdom among the mature, but a wisdom not of this world nor of the defeated rulers of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we speak a wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the world began for our glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">None of the rulers of this world knew it, for if they had known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But as it is written, "What eye has not seen and what ear has not heard and what has not entered human mind, God has prepared for those who love him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">To us God has revealed this by his Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For who of men knows what pertains to a man except the spirit of the man which is in him. Just so no one knows what pertains to God except the Spirit of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we know the gracious gifts of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And these we speak of, not in words taught by man's wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual things in spiritual words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But the animal man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, nor can he know them because they are spiritually understood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the spiritual man understands all things though he himself is understood by no one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For "Who has known the mind of the Lord? Who will teach him?" But we have the mind of Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">AND I myself, brethren, could not speak to you as spiritual, but as fleshly, as babes in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I fed you with milk, not solid food. For you were not able to take it. Nor are you yet able, for you are still fleshly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and living in man's way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For when one says, "I belong to Paul," and another, "I belong to Apollos," are you not men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to faith, as the Lord granted to each of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I planted, Apollos watered, but God made the seed grow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So then neither is he who planted anything nor he who watered, but God who makes the seed grow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">We are God's fellow workers: you are God's farm God's building.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">According to the grace of God granted to me, as a wise master-builder I have laid a foundation and another is building on it. But let each be careful how he builds on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If any one builds on this foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, straw \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">every one's work will become manifest. For the day will show it, because it will be revealed in fire and the fire will test each one's work, of what quality it is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If the work which any one has built stands he will get a reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If any one's work burns up he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but as through fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do you not know that you are God's temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If any one mars the temple of God, God will mar him, for the temple of God is holy, and you are the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Let no one deceive himself. If any one of you thinks himself wise in this world, let him become a fool in order to become wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. For it is written, "He catches the wise in their own craftiness,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and again, "The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise to be futile."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come \'97 all are yours</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and you are Christ's and Christ is God's.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">LET a man view us as servants of Christ and stewards of God's mysteries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Moreover, in the case of stewards it is required that a man be found faithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But it is of very slight importance to me to be judged by you or any human court. I do not even pass judgment on myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For I am not conscious of any wrong, but I am not proved by that to be faultless. The Lord is my judge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So do not judge anything before the time, before the Lord comes. He will throw light on the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the purposes of hearts. Then each one will have his praise from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">All this, brethren, I have applied to myself and Apollos for your sake, that you may learn the maxim, "Nothing beyond what is written," and may not be puffed up in partisanship for one against the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For who gives you superiority? What have you that you did not receive? Why are you boasting as if you had not received it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You are already fully satisfied. You have already become rich. You have become kings without us. Would that you had become kings so that we might be kings with you!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For it seems to me that God has set us apostles out last of all as men doomed to death, that we may be a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you have glory, but we are despised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Up to this present hour we are hungry and thirsty and naked and beaten. We wander about</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and labor, working with our own hands. When abused we bless, when persecuted we endure it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">when slandered we entreat. We have come to be, as it were, the sweepings of the world, the riffraff of all things up to now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For if you have ten thousand teachers in Christ, still you have not many fathers. For I was your father in Christ Jesus through the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So I beg you to be imitators of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this very purpose I have sent to you Timothy, who is my loved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ \'97 how I teach everywhere in every church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Some persons have become puffed up, thinking that I am not coming to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I shall come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will find out, not the talk of these puffed-up ones, but their power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the kingdom of God is not in talk, but in power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Which do you wish? Shall I come with a rod or in love and a spirit of gentleness?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">IT is generally reported that there is unchastity among you, and such unchastity as is not even among the Gentiles, so that a man has his father's wife!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And you are puffed up with pride and have not rather grieved and taken steps to expel from among you the doer of this deed!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I, absent in body, but present in spirit, have already as if I were present judged the man who has acted thus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When you assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit was also present with the power of our Lord Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I decided to deliver over such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Your boasting is unbecoming. Do you not know that a little yeast sets the whole mass fermenting?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Cleanse out the old yeast that you may be new dough, free from yeast, as indeed you are. For Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So let us keep the festival, not with the old yeast nor with the yeast of evil and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with unchaste people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">certainly not meaning the unchaste of this world, or the covetous or extortionate or idolaters, since in that case you would have to leave the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But now I write to you not to associate with any one who is called a brother, if he is unchaste or covetous or idolatrous or abusive or drunken or extortionate \'97 not even to eat with such a one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For what business of mine is it to judge outsiders? Is it not for you to judge those inside?</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">DOES any one of you, if he has a grievance against another, dare to bring the case before the unrighteous and not before the holy?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">If then you have affairs of this life, do you ask men who in the view of the church count for nothing to sit as judges?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I say this to your shame. Is it true that there is among you no one wise enough to judge between a man and his brother,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but brother goes to law with brother and that before unbelievers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now this is an utter failure on your part that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But you yourselves practice wrongs and frauds \'97 and that upon your brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit the kingdom of God? Make no mistake, neither the unchaste, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who practice unnatural vices,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">nor thieves, nor the avaricious, nor drunkards, nor the abusive, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And such some of you were. But you have washed yourselves; but you have been made holy; but you have been pronounced righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All things are lawful for me, but not everything is beneficial. All things are lawful, but I will not be overpowered by anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Food of all kinds is for the stomach and the stomach for foods. But God will end the function of one and the other. The body is not for unchastity, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">God raised the Lord and will also raise us through his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do you not know that he who unites himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For God says, "The two shall become one flesh."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He who is united to the Lord is one spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Shun unchastity. Every other sin that a man does is apart from the body, but the unchaste sins against his own body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God, and that you are not your own?</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">WITH reference to the matters you wrote of: It is an excellent thing for a man not to touch a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But because of the prevailing unchastity, let each man have his own wife and each woman her own husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let the husband pay his wife conjugal dues and the wife her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The wife has not power over her own body, but her husband has. In the same way the husband has not power over his own body, but his wife has.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Do not deprive one another, unless by agreement for a time, that you may have freedom for prayer, and again come together. You must not let Satan tempt you through your lack of self-control.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I say this by way of indulgence, not by way of command.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I wish that every one were just as I am. But each has his own gift from God, one in one way and one in another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I say to the unmarried and the widows, it is excellent for them to remain as I do.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">To the married I command \'97 yet not I, but the Lord \'97 that the wife is not to leave her husband</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he is pleased to live with her, let her not put him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the unbelieving husband has been made holy by the wife and the unbelieving wife has been made holy by the husband. Otherwise your children would be impure, but now they are holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if the unbelieving one actually leaves, let him leave. The brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases; but God has called you to peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But, as the Lord has allotted to each, let each go on living as when God called him. So I prescribe in all the churches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Was any one already circumcised when called? Let him not efface it. Was any one called when uncircumcised? Let him not become circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God is all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Let each stay in that condition in which he was called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Were you called when a slave? Let it not trouble you. On the contrary, even if you can become free, take it in preference.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord's freedman. Just so the free man, when called, is the slave of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You were bought with a price. Do not become slaves of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Let each one, brethren, stay in that condition in which he was called, close to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In regard to unmarried women I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who through the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I think then that this is an excellent thing on account of the present distress \'97 that it is an excellent thing for a person to be unmarried.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Have you been bound to a wife? Seek not release. Have you been freed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But even if you marry, you have not sinned. Even if a maiden marries, she has not sinned. But such will have trouble in the flesh, and I would spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But this I say, brethren: The time is shortened. For what remains let those who have wives be as if they had none,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and those who weep as if they wept not, and those who rejoice as if they rejoiced not, and those who buy as if they possessed nothing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and those who use the world as if not overusing it. For the present order of this world is passing away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I wish you to be free from worry. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord \'97 how be may please the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The married man is anxious about the things of the world \'97 how he may please his wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">and his interest is divided. So the unmarried woman or the maiden is anxious about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about the things of the world \'97 how she may please her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">This I say for your benefit, not to throw a noose over you, but to promote decorum and constant devotion to the Lord without distraction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">If any one thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin, if she is ripe for marriage and there is need, let him do what he will. He does not sin. Let them marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He who stands firm in his heart, having no necessity, and has power over his own will and has decided in his heart to keep his virgin, will do well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So he who marries his virgin does well, and he who does not marry her will do better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">A woman is bound as long as her husband is living. But if her husband falls asleep, she is free to marry whom she will, though only in the Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">NOW as to things that have been sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">If any one loves God, he is known by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Regarding the eating of things that have been sacrificed to idols, then, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And though there are so-called gods in heaven and on earth, for there are gods many and lords many,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">still to us there is one God the Father, of whom are all things and we for him, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and we through him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But all have not this knowledge. Some, having been accustomed to idols up to the present time, eat the food as a sacrifice to an idol, and their conscience being weak is stained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But food does not bring us near to God, for neither do we lose by not eating nor gain by eating.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But be careful that this power of yours may not become a stumbling block to the weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if any one sees you who have knowledge reclining at table in an idol's temple, will not the conscience of that weak one be emboldened to eat things that have been sacrificed to idols?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus the weak man is ruined by your knowledge \'97 the brother for whom Christ died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So sinning against the brethren and wounding their weak consciences you sin against Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Then will be the end when he delivers up the kingship to God his Father, when he has defeated every archangel and authority and power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For he must be king until he "puts all his enemies under his feet."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The last enemy to be defeated will be death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For "he subjected all things under his feet." But when it says, "all things have been subjected," it is plain that it means all things except God who subjected all things to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But when all things have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then what shall they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why are they then baptized for them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And why do we run risks every hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I die every day, I swear it by the boast I make of you and which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">If, humanly speaking, I fought wild beasts at Ephesus, what is my gain? If the dead do not rise, "let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Do not be led astray; "bad associations corrupt good morals."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Return to soberness and cease to sin, for some are ignorant of God. I say it to your shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But some one will say, How are the dead raised, and with what sort of bodies do they come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Thoughtless man! What you yourself sow does not come to life unless it dies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And what you sow is not the body that will come, but a mere grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But God gives it a body as he has pleased, and to each kind of seed a body of its own.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another flesh of birds, and another flesh of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">There are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial. But the glory of the celestial is of one kind and the glory of the terrestrial is of another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars. For star differs from star in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So also will be the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in decay; it is raised imperishable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">It is sown an animal body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is an animal body there is also a spiritual body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Just as it is written, "The first man Adam became a living animal," the last Adam became a lifegiving spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">But the spiritual is not first, but the animal, then the spiritual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The first man was from the earth, earthly; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">As is the earthly man such are also those who are earthly, and as is the heavenly man such are also those who are heavenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And as we have borne the image of the earthly man, we shall bear the image of the heavenly man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">But I say this, brethren, flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor will decay inherit imperishability.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">I am telling you a mystery. We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be transformed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet-call. For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be transformed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">For this perishable must clothe itself with imperishability, and this mortal must clothe itself with immortality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">When this perishable has clothed itself with imperishability and this mortal has clothed itself with immortality, then will come to pass the word that is written, "Death has been swallowed up in victory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">O Death, where is thy victory? O Death, where is thy sting?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; since you know that your labor is not fruitless in the Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">PAUL, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth with all the holy that are in all Achaia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of loving kindness and the God of all encouragement,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who encourages us in every distress so that we may be able to encourage those who are in every distress by the encouragement by which we ourselves have been encouraged by God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Because as the sufferings of Christ are abundant in our case, so through Christ our encouragement is abundant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if we are in distress, it is for your encouragement and salvation. If we are encouraged, it is for your encouragement which is effective in the endurance of the same sufferings that we suffer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Our hope is strong regarding you, since we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings so you are of the encouragement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, regarding the distress that came on us in Asia \'97 that we were exceedingly weighed down, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Indeed we have the sentence of death within ourselves, that our trust may not rest on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He delivered us from such a death and will deliver, and we have hope in him that he will go on delivering,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">while you help by your prayers for us, so that from many persons thanksgiving may arise for the gift granted to us through the prayers of many for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For this is what we boast of, the witness of our conscience that in holiness, and sincerity before God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have lived in the world and especially toward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For we are not writing to you anything but what you read and acknowledge and I hope you will acknowledge to the end,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">as you have partly acknowledged it about us, that we are your ground of boasting and you are ours on the day of our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">With this confidence I intended to come to you first, so that you might have a second favor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">by my visiting you on the way to Macedonia and again coming back from Macedonia to you and being sped by you on my way toward Juda.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When I was intending this, did I show fickleness? Or do I plan what I plan according to the flesh, so that I may say yes, yes, and no, no?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As God is faithful, my word to you is not yes and no.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was proclaimed among you by us \'97 myself and Silvanus and Timothy \'97 was not yes and no, but in him was yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For all the promises of God, however many, have their yes in him. Therefore also through him is the Amen to the glory of God through us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">It is God who makes us and you steadfast to Christ, and has anointed us</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">BUT I decided this in my own mind, not to come again to you in sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if I grieve you, who is there to cheer me except those who are grieved by me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I am writing this very thing so that I may not come and have grief from those who ought to make me glad, for I am confident in regard to all of you that my joy is yours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For out of great distress and pain of heart I am writing with many tears, not that you may be grieved, but that you may know the love that I have beyond measure for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if any one has caused grief, he has grieved not me, but to some extent \'97 not to be too severe \'97 all of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and encourage him, that such a one may not be swallowed up in excessive grief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore I beg you to assure him of your love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Because for this purpose I am writing, that I may know your tested character, whether you are obedient in everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">To whomever you forgive anything I also forgive it, and what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it was for your sake in the sight of Christ,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Thanks be to God who always leads us in his triumph in Christ and spreads through us the sweet odor of the knowledge of him in every place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we are for God a sweet odor of Christ \'97 in the saved and in the perishing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To the latter an odor from death to death, to the former an odor from life to life. And who is competent for this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For we are not, like the most, adulterating the message of God for gain, but in sincerity, as from God, in the presence of God, we speak in Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">ARE we beginning again to recommend ourselves? Do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you or from you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">evidently a letter of Christ delivered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets, but on tablets that are hearts of flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">We have such confidence through Christ toward God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Not that of ourselves we are fit to reason out anything as from ourselves, but our fitness is from God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who has fitted us to be servants of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the spirit. For the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If the service that brought death, engraved in letters on stones, came in glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face \'97 that fading glory \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">how much more glorious will not the service of the Spirit be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if the service that brought condemnation was glory, much more will the service that brings righteousness surpass in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For what was made so glorious is in a way no longer glorious compared with the glory that surpasses it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if what was to be ended came in glory, much more glorious must be that which is enduring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">With such a hope then we speak with great frankness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and are not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel might not see when the vanishing glory ended;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but their thinking was dulled. For to this day the same veil remains unlifted when the old covenant is read; because it is done away only in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">To this day when Moses is read the veil lies on their hearts;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"but when they turn to the Lord the veil is taken away."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And we all, with unveiled face, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same likeness from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THEREFORE, having this service through God's mercy, we are not downhearted,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but we have renounced shameful secret things, not living in craftiness nor adulterating God's message, but by the openness of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If our good news is veiled, it is veiled to those who are going to ruin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">in whom the god of this world has blinded the thinking of the unbelieving so that the light of the glorious good news of Christ, who is the image of God, may not shine in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we are not proclaiming ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Because it is the God who said, "Light shall shine out of darkness," who has shone in our hearts bringing the light of the glorious knowledge of God in the face of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we have this treasure in earthen jars, that the surpassing power may be God's and not ours \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">in every way distressed, but not reduced to straits, perplexed, but not in despair,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">persecuted, but not forsaken, cast down, but not destroyed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">always bearing about in our bodies the death of Jesus that the life also of Jesus may be manifest in our bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For we, though living, are always delivered up to death for Jesus' sake, that also the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So death works in us, but life in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Having the same spirit of faith, as it is written, "I believed, therefore I spoke," we too believe and therefore speak,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">knowing that he who raised up Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus and place us in his presence with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For all things are for your sake, that grace abounding through many may overflow in thanksgiving to the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore we are not downhearted, but even if our outward man is wasting away, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For our momentary and light distress is working out for us a far surpassing and eternal weight of glory</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">while we contemplate not the things that are seen, but the things unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things unseen are eternal.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">FOR we know that if this tent, our earthly home, is thrown down, we have a building of God, a home not made by hands, eternal in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For in this we sigh in earnest desire to put on our dwelling that comes from heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">since if we put that on we shall not be found naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For while we are in this tent we sigh being burdened, not that we wish to be unclothed, but to put on the other, that what is mortal may be swallowed up in life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, and he has given to us the pledge of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So being always of good courage and knowing that while living at home in the body we are living in a foreign land away from the Lord \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">for we walk by faith, not by sight \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I say we are of good courage and wish rather to live in the land foreign to the body and be at home with the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore also we are ambitious to be pleasing to him, whether at home with him or in this foreign land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For we must all appear as we truly are before the judgment seat of Christ, that each may receive the award for what he has done with his body, according to his actions, whether good or bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Knowing, therefore, the fear of the Lord, we are persuading men. What we are is plain to God, and I hope that it is also plain to your consciences.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">We are not recommending ourselves again to you, but giving occasion to you for boasting on our behalf, that you may have it to use against those who boast of appearances and not of heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if we were out of our minds it was for God, and if we are sane it is for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the love of Christ impels us, convinced of this, that if one died for all, then all died,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and he died for all that the living may no longer live for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So we, from now on, know no man according to the flesh. Even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So if any one is in Christ he is a new creature. The old things have passed away, they have become new.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And all things are from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and given to us the service of reconciliation \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">to proclaim that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting against men their sins, and that he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So we are ambassadors for Christ, as if God were appealing to you through us. We pray you on Christ's behalf to be reconciled to God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I am not saying this to condemn you, for I have already said that you have such a place in our hearts that we are ready to die with you or to live with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Great is my frankness in speaking to you; great is my boasting of you; I am filled with encouragement, running over with joy at every distress of ours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For since we came to Macedonia our flesh has had no rest, but we have been distressed in every way, conflicts without, fears within.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But God, who encourages the depressed, encouraged us by the coming of Titus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and not by his coming only, but also by the encouragement by which he was encouraged about you. He told us of your longing for me, your lamentation, your zeal in my behalf, so that I rejoice the more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if I grieved you in my letter I do not regret it, though I did regret it, seeing that that letter grieved you even for a time,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but I am glad now, not that you were grieved, but that your grief led to a change of heart. You were grieved as God approves so that you should in nothing suffer loss from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For such grief as God approves works a change of heart leading to salvation and is never to be regretted. But the grief of the world results in death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Notice this very grieving as God approves, how great earnestness resulted from it in your case, what effort to defend yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what just punishment! In everything you showed yourselves blameless in the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So although I wrote to you, I did it not for the sake of him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong, but that your earnestness for us might be made plain to you before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">On this account we have been encouraged. In addition to this encouragement of ours, we rejoiced very much more over the joy of Titus because his spirit has been refreshed by you all,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">for if I have made any boast regarding you I have not been put to shame, but as we spoke everything in truth to you so our boasting over Titus turned out the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And his affections go out more strongly to you when he remembers the obedience of you all, how with reverence and trembling you received him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I am glad to be in every respect of good courage regarding you.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I MUST tell you, brethren, of the grace of God that has been given to the churches of Macedonia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that in a great trial of distress their abundant joy and their deep poverty have abounded in the wealth of their liberality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For according to their ability, I bear witness, and beyond their ability, of their own accord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">with great urgency they begged of us the favor of fellowship in the service for the holy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and this not as we had hoped, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us through the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore we encouraged Titus that as he had begun so he should complete this grace among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But as you excel in every way, in faith and speech and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love you learned from us, be sure to excel in this grace also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I speak not by way of command, but testing the genuineness of your love by the earnestness of others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich yet for your sake he became poor, that you by his poverty might become rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">In this I give my opinion, for this is advantageous for you, since a year ago you were first to begin not only the doing but the wanting to do anything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But now complete the doing, that as there was a readiness in willing so there may be a completion according to your means.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For if there is first the readiness, a gift is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to what he has not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I do not mean that others shall have relief and you shall have trouble,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but by equality at the present time your abundance may supply their need so that their abundance may come at your need \'97 that there may be equality,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">as it is written, "He who gathered much had nothing over and he who gathered little had no lack."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Thanks be to God who puts into the heart of Titus the same interest in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he welcomed our appeal, but being unusually interested comes to you of his own choice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">With him we are sending the brother whose praise for service to the good news has spread through all the churches,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and not only that, but he was appointed by the churches as our fellow traveler in this gracious errand carried out by us to the glory of the Lord himself and by our own eager desire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">We are taking care that no one shall blame us for our administration of this bountiful fund,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for we are providing arrangements honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">We are sending along with them also our brother whose earnestness we have tested many times in many ways, and who is now especially earnest because of his great confidence in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">If any one asks about Titus, he is my intimate friend and fellow worker for you. If it is our brethren, they are the messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">REGARDING the service to the holy, it is superfluous for me to write to you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I am sending the brethren that our boasting about you may not be proved in this matter an empty boast, so that you may be ready as I have said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to say you, may not be made ashamed of this confidence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So I think it necessary to urge the brethren to go on in advance to you and prepare before-hand your promised gift, that it may be ready as a gift and not as if extorted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Remember this, he who sows sparingly will reap sparingly and he who sows bountifully will reap bountifully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Let each give as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly nor of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">God is able to make every blessing abound for you so that having in everything always all that you need, you may abound in every good work,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and make abundant your seed and will increase the fruits of your righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You will be enriched in everything so that you will have all liberality which through our agency causes thanksgiving to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the performance of this sacred service not only supplies the needs of the holy, but also overflows to God in many thanksgivings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">By the proof afforded by this service men are led to glorify God for your fidelity to your profession of faith in the good news of Christ, and for the liberality of your contributions toward them and toward all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In their prayers in your behalf they pour out their longing love for you because of the surpassing grace of God that is upon you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">He who supplies to you the Spirit and works miracles among you, is he doing it because of works of law or because of hearing with faith,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">just as Abraham had faith in God and it was credited to him for righteousness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You know, then, that those who are of faith \'97 they are children of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Scripture, foreseeing that God would declare the Gentiles righteous because of faith, announced the good news in advance to Abraham, "In you all the Gentiles will be blessed."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So then those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For all who are of the works of law are under a curse, for it is written, "Cursed is every one who does not abide by all the precepts of the book of the Law and do them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But that by law no one is declared righteous before God is plain, because, "He who is righteous by faith shall live."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the Law is not of faith, but "He who does these things shall live by them."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for our sake, for it is written, "Cursed is every one who hangs on a tree,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">in order that the blessing of Abraham might in Jesus Christ come on the Gentiles, that they might receive through faith the promise of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Brethren, I am speaking humanly, a ratified covenant, although but a man's, no one can set aside or add to.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, "and to offsprings," as meaning many, but as if meaning one, "and to your offspring," who is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I mean this, a covenant ratified by God, the Law that came four hundred and thirty years afterward does not annul, so as to defeat the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if the inheritance is by law, it is no longer by promise. But God granted it to Abraham by promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Why then was the Law? It was added later to make transgressions, until the Offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was arranged through angels by the hand of a mediator.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">A mediator does not belong to one person, but God is one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Is the Law then against the promises of God? Never! For if a law had been given which could give life, then really righteousness would have come by law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the Scripture has shut up all under sin that the promise based on faith in Jesus Christ may be given to those who have faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Before faith came we were guarded under law, shut up waiting for the faith that was to be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Thus the Law became our tutor leading us to Christ, that we might be declared righteous by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">There cannot be Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female: for you all are one in Christ Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I SAY that as long as the heir is under age he differs in nothing from a slave, though he be owner of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But he is under guardians and managers until the day appointed by the father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So we, when we were under age, were enslaved under the elementary lessons of the world;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but, when the fullness of time came, God sent forth his Son born of a woman, born under the Law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that he might redeem those who were under Law, that we might receive the recognition as sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Because you are sons, God has sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son crying Abba, Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then also an heir, through God's act.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">At the time when you did not know God you were enslaved to what by nature are not gods.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">They are paying court to you, but not honorably. No, they wish to shut you out, so that you may pay court to them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">my children, for whom I again am suffering birth pangs until Christ is formed in you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me, you who wish to be under law, do you not hear the Law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one born of the slave girl and one born of the free wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he who was born of the slave girl was born according to the flesh, while he who was born of the free wife was born by promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This is an allegory. For these women are the two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery. This is Hagar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia. She represents the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery along with her children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the Jerusalem on high is free and she is our mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it is written, "Rejoice, O barren one, you who do not bear! Break forth and shout, you who feel no birth pangs! For many are the children of the desolate \'97 more than those of her who has a husband."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But you, brethren, are, as Isaac was, children of promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But just as then he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But what says the Scripture? "Cast out the slave girl and her son. For the son of the slave girl shall not inherit along with the son of the free wife."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore, brethren, we are not children of a slave girl, but of the free wife.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">STAND firm, therefore, in the freedom with which Christ set us free, and do not wear any yoke of slavery.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation to carry out the whole Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You have put an end to Christ's work for you, you who are declared righteous by law; you have fallen away from grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we in the Spirit because of faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For in Christ Jesus neither has circumcision any value nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You were running finely. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Would that those who are troubling you would even cut off all!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not let your freedom be an opportunity for the flesh, but in love be servants to one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the whole Law is summed up in one word: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not destroyed by one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I say, walk in the Spirit and you will not carry out the passions of the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the flesh has passions contrary to the Spirit and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do whatever you wish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The works of the flesh are obvious, such as unchastity, impurity, indecency,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">envyings, drinking bouts, revelries, and the like. Of these I tell you beforehand, as I have already told you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, slowness to anger, kindness, benevolence, faithfulness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">gentleness, self-control; against such there is no law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its emotions and passions.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun the good work in you will carry it on to completion on the day of Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So it is right for me to think of you all, because you have me in your hearts, and in my chains and in my defense and in establishing the good news you are all sharers in my privilege.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For God is my witness how much I long for you all in the affections of Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And this is my prayer that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all insight,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">What then? Still in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed and in that I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I know that this will make for my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">according to my earnest expectation and hope that I may be put to shame in nothing, but with all courage, as always, so now Christ may be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Do not be each intent on his own interests, but also on the interests of others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who, though he was in the form of God, did not think that equality with God was something to be grasped,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore, God has highly exalted him and has graciously given him the name which is above every name,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">YOU yourselves know, brethren, what a reception we had from you, that it was not without result,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For this reason we unceasingly give thanks to God that when you received from us the report of the message of God you accepted it not as the message of men, but, as it truly is, the message of God, which also is doing its work in you who believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For you became imitators, brethren, of the churches of God that are in Judaea in Christ Jesus, because you too suffered the same things from your fellow countrymen that they did from the Jews,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">PAUL, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the appointment of God, our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to Timothy my true child in faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">As I begged you to stay in Ephesus when I was leaving for Macedonia, that you might charge some not to teach new and strange doctrines</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">nor give attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote disputes rather than God's plan in the faith, so I beg you now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The aim of the commandment is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Some missing these have turned aside to empty talk,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">wishing to be teachers of the Law, but not understanding either what they are saying or what the things are that they are so positive about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We know that the Law is excellent, if any one uses it lawfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we know this: that law is not laid down for a righteous man, but for the lawless and the insubordinate, the ungodly and sinners, the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for the unchaste, for those who practice unnatural vices, for slave-dealers, liars, perjurers, and for whatever else is contrary to wholesome teaching</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">such as accords with the glorious good news of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has given me strength, because he thought me faithful and put me into his service,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">though before that I spoke profanely and was a persecutor and insolent in outrages. But I received mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the grace of our Lord overflowed in me with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The saying is trust-worthy and deserving of full acceptance that "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners," of whom I am the foremost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might show all of his long-suffering for an example for those who are to believe in him and gain life eternal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">To the King of the ages, the immortal, invisible, only God, be honor and glory for the ages of the ages! Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This command I lay down for you, my child Timothy, in accordance with the prophecies that came in advance regarding you, in order that armed with them you may wage the noble war,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">holding to faith and a good conscience, which some have cast aside and thus made shipwreck of their faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, that they may learn not to speak profanely.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I BEG, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, supplications, and thanksgivings be made in behalf of all men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in behalf of kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and sobriety.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">This is excellent and pleasing in the sight of God, our Savior,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who wishes all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who gave himself as a ransom for all, a fact to be witnessed to at the fitting time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">To this I was appointed a herald and an apostle \'97 I am telling the truth, I am not lying \'97 a teacher of Gentiles in faith and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I wish, then, that the men offer prayer in every place, lifting up holy hands without wrath or debate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also that the women adorn themselves in becoming dress modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">but \'97 as is becoming for women professing piety \'97 with good deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">A woman is to learn in all subjection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I do not permit a woman to teach or to usurp authority over a man, but she must remain silent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Adam was first formed, then Eve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Adam was not deceived; the woman was deceived and fell into sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they will be saved through child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THE saying is trustworthy: "If any one aspires to the office of a bishop, he desires a noble work."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A bishop, then, should be above reproach, true to one woman, temperate, self-controlled, dignified, hospitable, with a gift for teaching,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">not given to wine or to blows, but fair-minded, averse to strife, not a lover of money,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">presiding well over his own house, with children obedient and respectful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if any one does not know how to preside over his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He must not be a new convert, for fear he may be blinded by pride and fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He must have a good reputation with outsiders so as not to fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Deacons, in the same way, must be dignified, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not eager for base gain,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They must first be tested, and then let them fill the office of deacon if there is nothing against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Women, in the same way, must be dignified, not slanderers, temperate, trustworthy in everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Deacons must be men true to one woman, presiding well over their children and their own houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Those who have filled the office of deacon well win for themselves a high standing and great boldness in the faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am writing these things to you, although I hope to come to you soon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but so that if I am delayed you may know how people should conduct themselves in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Confessedly great is the mystery of godliness: "Who was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up in glory."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THE Spirit says distinctly that in later times some will desert from the faith, giving attention to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">through the hypocrisy of men who teach falsely, branded in their own consciences,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">forbidding marriage, and insisting on abstinence from certain kinds of food which God made to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who are faithful and know the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For everything made by God is excellent and nothing is to be rejected if taken with thanksgiving.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For it is made holy through God's message and through prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In teaching this to the brethren you will be a noble servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of the faith and of the excellent teaching which you have followed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But avoid profane and old-womanish myths. Exercise yourself in godliness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Bodily exercise is useful to a small degree, but godliness is useful for everything. "It has the promise of the present life and of the life that is to come."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For to this end we are laboring and wrestling, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Command and teach these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let no one look down on you because you are young, but be an example to believers in speech, in the life you lead, in love, in faith, in purity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Until I come give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Be careful about these things, be fully occupied with them, that your progress may be plain to all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Be thoughtful about yourself and your teaching. Persevere in this; for in doing so you will save yourself and those who hear you.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Do not rebuke an older man, but entreat him as a father, the younger men as brothers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">the older women as mothers and the younger women as sisters, in all purity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Honor widows if they are really widows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to act piously toward their own family and to repay what they owe to their parents and grandparents. For this is pleasing in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A real widow who is left alone has set her hope on God and devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the pleasure-loving widow, though living, is already dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Give these commands that they may be free from reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If any one does not provide for his own, and especially those of his own household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">A widow is to be put on the list if she has reached the age of not less than sixty years, if she has been true to one husband,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">has a reputation for good deeds, has brought up children, has entertained strangers, has washed the feet of the holy, has ministered to people in distress, has been active in every good work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But younger widows refuse, for when wanton desires lead them away from Christ they wish to marry</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and thus they incur condemnation for breaking their first promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">At the same time they learn to be idle, going around from house to house, and not only idle, but gossips, and busybodies, saying what they should not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I would, therefore, have the younger widows marry, bear children, keep house, give no occasion to our enemies for slander.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For already some have turned aside after Satan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If any woman who is a believer has widows, she must provide for them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may provide for those who are really widows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The elders who preside well should be thought worthy of double salary, especially those who labor in speaking and teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is treading out the grain," and <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">the workman deserves his wages.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Against an elder do not receive an accusation unless on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Those who are going on in sin rebuke before all, that the rest may fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels to observe these directions without prejudice, doing nothing through partiality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Do not lay hands of ordination upon any one hastily. Have no share in the sins of other men. Keep yourself pure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Do not keep on being a water-drinker, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and because of your frequent ailments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Some men's sins are conspicuous and go on before to condemnation, but the sins of some men follow after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Just so noble deeds are conspicuous and those that are otherwise cannot be hid.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">ALL who are slaves under the yoke must regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be profanely slandered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Those who have believing masters must not despise them because they are brothers, but rather work as slaves for them because those who are benefited by their good work are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If any one teaches otherwise and does not agree to wholesome words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to religious teaching,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">he is conceited, knowing nothing, but morbidly fond of disputes and controversies from which come envy, strife, abusive language, wicked suspicions,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and wranglings of men of depraved minds who are destitute of the truth. They think of religion as a source of gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Religion with contentment is a great source of gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For we brought nothing into the world and we cannot carry anything out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If we have food and clothing we will be content with these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and injurious passions which plunge men into destruction and ruin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some men grasping for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pangs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But you, O man of God, must shun this. Pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Play the grand hard game of the faith. Lay hold on life eternal, to which you have been called and have made the noble confession before many witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I charge you in the presence of God who gives life to all, and Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the noble confession,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">to keep the commandment stainless and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">which in due time he will show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who alone has immortality, who dwells in light unapproachable, whom no man has seen or can see. To him be honor and power eternal! Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Command those who are rich in this world not to be haughty nor to fix their hope on uncertain wealth, but on God who provides all things richly for our enjoyment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They must do good work, be rich in noble deeds, be generous, ready to share,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">treasuring up for themselves a good fund for the future, that they may lay hold on the life that is real.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, turning away from profane and empty talk and contradictions of what is falsely called "knowledge."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Some while professing it have gone astray as regards the faith. Grace be with you all.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">PAUL, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to Timothy my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I thank God whom, I serve, following in the steps of my forefathers, with a pure conscience, while I constantly mention you in my prayers night and day,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">remembering your tears and longing to see you, that I may be filled with joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I remember the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and then in your mother Eunice, and I am confident that it lives in you also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For this reason let me remind you to kindle anew the gift of God that is in you by the laying on of my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and self-control.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Do not be ashamed to testify for our Lord or for me his prisoner, but join in suffering hardships for the good news as God gives power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It is he who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our deeds but according to his own purpose and grace, given to us in Christ Jesus ages ago</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">but now manifested by the appearance of our Savior Christ Jesus, who has defeated death and brought to light life and immortality by the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For this I was made a herald and an apostle and a teacher,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and for this reason I am suffering these things. But I am not ashamed, for I know in whom I have put my faith, and am confident that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Hold to the example of wholesome words which you heard from me in faith and love in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Guard through the Holy Spirit which dwells in us the precious trust committed to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">You know that all of those in Asia have deserted me. Among them are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, for he often cheered me and was not ashamed of my chain;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">but when he came to Rome he looked me up eagerly and found me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day! And in how many ways he served me in Ephesus you know better still.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">YOU, therefore, my child, must be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and the things you heard from me, which came through many witnesses, you must commit to trustworthy men who will be able to teach others also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Take your share of hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">No one while serving as a soldier entangles himself in the affairs of life, for the soldier must please him who enlisted him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And if any one enters an athletic contest, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The farmer who does the labor ought first to have his share of the fruits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Think over what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as my good news teaches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In telling it I am suffering hardships even to chains, as if I were an evildoer, but God's message is not chained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For this reason I am enduring all for the sake of the chosen, that they may gain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Trustworthy is the saying, "For if we have died with him we shall also live with him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">if we endure we shall also be kings with him; if we disown him, he will disown us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">if we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he cannot disown himself."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Remind them of these things, charging them before God not to engage in controversy to no profit, but to the ruin of the hearers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Be earnest in presenting yourself to God as a tested man, a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, rightly handling the message of truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But shun profane and empty talk. It will grow into greater impiety,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and its teachings will spread like a gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They have gone astray as to the truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they are overthrowing the faith of some.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">However, God's solid foundation stands, with this inscription, "The Lord knows his own," and, "Let every one who names the Lord's name turn from wickedness."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">In a great house there are not only utensils of gold and silver, but also of wood and earthenware, and some are for honorable and others for dishonorable uses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">If any one keeps himself pure from these errors, he will be ready for honorable use, holy, fit for the master's service, prepared for every good work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But flee the passions of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, in the company of those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Avoid foolish disputes of the uneducated, knowing that they give rise to quarrels,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and the servant of the Lord must not quarrel, but be courteous to all, skillful in teaching, forbearing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">instructing opponents with gentleness, for God may give them a change of heart which will lead them to knowledge of the truth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and they may return to soberness and escape the snare of the Devil when captured by the Lord's servant to do the Lord's will.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I WOULD have you know this, that in the last days trying times will come;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">without family affection, relentless, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, haters of good,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They will have a form of religion, but will cast off its power. Avoid such people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men oppose the truth, depraved in mind, proved to be worthless as regards the faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But they will go no further, for their folly will be manifest to all as that of Jannes and Jambres became.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And all who are determined to live religiously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Wicked men and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For there will be a time when they will not endure wholesome teaching, but following their own fancies and wishing to have their ears tickled, they will get a crowd of teachers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They will turn their ears away from the truth and give attention to myths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But you must be calm in all circumstances, suffer hardships, do the work of a bringer of the good news, carry out fully all the duties of your office.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">MANY times and in many ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">but at the end of these days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things and through whom he made the world,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">who is the reflection of his glory and the expression of his nature and sustains all things by his word of power, and who, when he had made purification from sins, took his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">having become as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited surpasses theirs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For to which of the angels did he ever say, "Thou art my son; I have to-day become thy Father"? and again, "I will be to him a Father and he shall be to me a Son"?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And again when he brings his first-born into the world of men he says, "And let all the angels of God bow down to him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Referring to the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, his servants a flame of fire."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But regarding the Son he says, "Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever. Thy royal scepter is a scepter of justice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Thou lovest righteousness and hatest lawlessness, therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy companions."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, "Thou, in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth, and the heavens are works of thy hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They will perish, but thou wilt endure. They all will grow old like a garment</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and like a mantle thou wilt roll them up. But thou art the same and thy years will never end."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">To which of the angels did he ever say, "Sit at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool"?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth for service in behalf of those who are to inherit salvation?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">FOR this reason we should give special attention to the things that we have heard, so as not to drift away from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if the message spoken through angels was sure and every violation and disobedience received merited punishment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the beginning was spoken by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">while God added his testimony by signs and wonders and many kinds of miracles and impartation of the Holy Spirit according to his will?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For he has not subjected to angels the coming world of which we speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But somewhere one says, "What is man that thou rememberest him? Or the son of man that thou carest for him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels. With glory and honor thou hast crowned him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All things thou hast put under his feet." When he put all things under him he left nothing that was not put under him. We do not yet see all things put under him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death that by the grace of God he might taste of death for every man, now crowned with glory and honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For it was fitting that he through whom are all things and for whom are all things, when leading many sons to glory, should make the great Leader of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For he who makes holy and they who are made holy are all of one. For this cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">saying, "I will tell thy name to my brothers. In the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to thee,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and again, "I will trust in him," and again, "Here am I and the children whom God has given me."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Since then the children share in blood and flesh, he himself in the same way shared in them, in order that through death he might defeat him who had the power of death, that is, the Devil,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and set free all those who through fear of death were all their lives doomed to slavery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For he does not come to the help of angels, but he comes to the help of the descendants of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And for that reason he had to be made like his brethren in everything, so as to be a compassionate and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">THEREFORE, holy brethren, sharers in a heavenly call, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For he has been thought worthy of more glory than Moses, just as he who has built a house has more honor than the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For every house is built by some one, but he who built all things is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant for a testimony to the things that were to be spoken,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but Christ as a Son over his own house. We are his house if we hold firmly to the end our confidence and the hope of which we boast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "To-day if you will hear his voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">do not harden your hearts as when they made me angry on the day when they tried me in the desert,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">when your fathers put me to a test and saw my deeds for forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore I was much displeased with that generation and said, 'They always go astray in their hearts and they do not know my paths.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter into my rest.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">See to it, brethren, that there shall not be in any one of you a wicked, unbelieving heart ready to forsake the living God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">but encourage one another daily while it is called "to-day," that no one may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we become sharers with Christ if we hold firmly to the end the assurance with which we began.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">When it is said, "To-day if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as when they made me angry" \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who when they heard made him angry? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">With whom was he much displeased for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">To whom did he swear that they should not enter his rest, except to those who had no faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We see that they were unable to enter because of their lack of faith.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">LET us, then, be afraid that, though the promise of entering his rest is still left, some one of you may seem to have missed it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For we have received the good news just as they did, but the message that was heard did not benefit them, since it did not meet with faith in the hearers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we who have faith are entering into the rest, as he said, "As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter into my rest,' " although his works had been finished since the creation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day thus, "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and in this place again, "They shall not enter into my rest."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Since, then, it remains for some to enter into it, and those who first received the good news did not enter because of lack of faith \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">again he indicates a day, "to-day," saying in David so long after, as has been already quoted, "To-day if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if Joshua had given them rest he would not be speaking of another day after that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore there still remains a rest for the people of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he who has entered into God's rest has rested from his works as God did from his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let us endeavor then to enter into that rest so that no one shall fall, after that example of lack of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any two-edged sword, and it pierces until it divides soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There is not a creature invisible to him, but all things are naked and defenseless before the eyes of him to whom we must account.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Since, then, we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we have not a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, for he has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore let us come with confidence to the throne of grace and receive compassion and find grace for timely help.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">FOR every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men in things relating to God to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He is able to sympathize with the ignorant and the erring, since he himself is beset with weaknesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this reason he must bring an offering for his own sins, just as he does for those of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And no one takes this honor upon himself unless called by God, as Aaron was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So too Christ did not take for himself the glory of becoming a high priest, but he who said to him, "Thou art my Son, to-day I have become thy Father,"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and who says in another place, "Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Christ, in the days of his flesh, offered prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death, with strong outcries and tears, and was heard and saved from his terrors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Although he was a Son he learned obedience from his sufferings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and being thus made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and was proclaimed by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Regarding Melchizedek we have much to say that is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For when, considering the time, you ought to be teachers you need to have some one teach you again the first principles of the revelations of God. You have come to need milk and not solid food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For every one who takes milk is inexperienced in the doctrine of righteousness, for he is a child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But solid food is for adults who through practice have their senses exercised in distinguishing good and bad.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THEREFORE let us leave elementary teaching about Christ and hasten on to what is advanced, not laying again a foundation \'97 change of heart from dead works, faith in God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">the teaching about baptisms, the laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">This we will do if God permits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible for those who have been once for all enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have become sharers in the Holy Spirit</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and have tasted God's word and the powers of the coming world,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and then have fallen away, to have again a change of heart, since they are crucifying for themselves afresh the Son of God and putting him to open shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it and bears plants useful to those for whom it is farmed shares in God's blessing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but if it bears thorns and thistles it is judged worthless and is near to being cursed. In the end it will be burnt over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we are persuaded of better things regarding you, beloved, things that belong with salvation, though we thus speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love that you have shown to his name as you have served and are still serving the holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But we desire to have each one of you show to the end the same earnestness for the fulfillment of our hope,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that you may not be dull, but imitators of those who through faith and patience are inheriting the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For God, when making the promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, swore by himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">saying, "Surely, I will greatly bless you and greatly multiply you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And so after patient waiting Abraham obtained what was promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For men swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them the end of all dispute.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">that by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible for God to be false, we might have strong encouragement, we who have fled to lay hold on the hope that lies before us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">We have this hope as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and it enters into the tent within the curtain</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered in our behalf, becoming forever a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">FOR, this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham when he was returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and to whom Abraham gave a tenth of all <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">first, by the translation of his name, "King of Righteousness," and then king of Salem, which means "King of Peace"</NOTE></DIV>,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">without father, without mother, without ancestors, without either birthday or end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest permanently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But see how great this man was, since Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of his choicest spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And even those of the sons of Levi who attain the priesthood have command according to the Law to take a tenth from the people, their own brethren, although these have sprung from the loins of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he who had no genealogy from these took a tenth from Abraham and pronounced a blessing on him who had the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Without dispute the less is blessed by the greater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And here mortal men receive tenths, but there one of whom the witness is that he is living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And, to put it frankly, Levi, who receives the tenths, was made to pay a tenth through Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If, then, perfection had been through the Levitical priesthood, \'97 for on the basis of that the people received the Law \'97 what need was there for another kind of priest to arise and not be called of the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For when the priesthood has been changed there comes of necessity also a change of law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has ever had anything to do with the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is plain that our Lord has arisen from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And this is yet more abundantly evident if after the order of Melchizedek there arises a priest of a different kind</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">who has become such, not according to the law of a commandment made for the flesh, but according to the power of unending life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it is affirmed of him, "Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There is a setting aside of the earlier commandment because of its weakness and uselessness \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">for the Law brought nothing to perfection \'97 and there is the bringing in of a better hope through which we draw near to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And just as it was not without an oath \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for those men have become priests without an oath, but he with an oath from him who said to him, "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: thou art a priest forever" \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">by so much better is the covenant of which Jesus has become surety.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And many of them became priests because they were prevented by death from continuing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but he, because he continues forever, has an unending priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And so he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him, since he is forever living to intercede for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For such was the High Priest that we needed, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He has not the daily need, like the other priests, first to offer sacrifices for his own sins and then for those of the people. This latter he did once for all when he offered himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the Law makes high priests of men who have infirmities, but the word of the oath, which comes after the Law, makes High Priest of a Son who is perfected forever.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THE chief point of what I have been saying is this: we have such a High Priest who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and who ministers in the holy place and in the true Tent set up by the Lord, not by man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Whence it is necessary for this one to have something to offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If he were upon the earth he would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They minister as an example and shadow of the things in heaven, just as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the Tent. "See," it was said, "that you make everything according to the model shown you on the mountain."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now Christ has obtained a ministry as much more excellent as the covenant of which he is mediator is better and based upon better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first covenant had been faultless a place would not have been sought for a second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But finding fault with it he says, "The days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new covenant,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">not in the manner of the covenant which I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not abide by my covenant and I ceased to care for them, says the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts and I will be their God and they will be my people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They shall not teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother saying, 'Know the Lord'; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and I will be merciful to their wrong-doings and their sins I will remember no more."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In saying "new" he has pronounced the first covenant old. But what grows old and decadent is near to disappearance.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THE first covenant had regulations of worship and its holy building in this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For a Tent was erected, in the first part of which were the lampstand and the table and the consecrated bread. This was called the Holy Place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Behind the second curtain was the part called the Holy of Holies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It had the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant all covered with gold. In this was a golden jar with the manna and Aaron's rod that sprouted and the tablets of the covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Above it were cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of propitiation. Regarding these things it is not now possible to speak in detail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But these things being thus arranged, the priests go constantly into the first part of the Tent, performing their services,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but into the second part the High Priest alone goes once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins ignorantly committed by the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Holy Spirit shows this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been made plain while the first Tent is standing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That is a symbol, for the time being, in accordance with which gifts and sacrifices are offered, though they cannot make the worshiper perfect in his conscience,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">since they consist only of foods and drinks and various baths \'97 rules respecting the flesh, imposed until the time of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when Christ came as High Priest of the good things that have come, he entered once for all through the greater and more perfect Tent not made by hands \'97 that is, not of this creation \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, into the holy place, and thereby found eternal redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the defiled, makes them holy as regards purity of their flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">how much more will the blood of Christ, who through an eternal Spirit offered himself an unblemished sacrifice to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works for the service of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this reason he is the mediator of a better covenant that, a death having taken place for redemption from sins under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the eternal inheritance promised to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where there is a last will and testament the death of the testator must be put in evidence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a will is valid in the case of the dead: it never has any force while the testator is living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Hence the first covenant was not introduced without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When all the commands of the Law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled it on the book and on all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded for you."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the Tent and all the things used in worship he likewise sprinkled with blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Almost everything is cleansed with blood, according to the Law, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It was necessary, then, that the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Christ did not enter into a holy place made by hands, a copy of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God in our behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Nor was it to offer himself often, as the High Priest enters into the holy place every year with blood not his own;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">then he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now, once for all, at the end of the ages, he has appeared to do away with sin by his sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as it is appointed for men once for all to die and after this comes judgment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">so Christ was once for all offered to bear the sins of many and will appear the second time, apart from sin, to those who are looking for him, and bring them salvation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">FOR the Law with a shadow of the good things that are coming, but not the very likeness of the things, cannot, by the same sacrifices which they offer constantly every year, ever make perfect those who come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">since would they not have ceased offering them? Because the worshipers, once for all cleansed, would have had no consciousness of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But in the sacrifices these are called to mind every year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore on coming into the world he says, "Sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire: a body thou hast prepared for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not delight in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I said, 'Here I have come \'97 in the roll of the book it is written of me \'97 to do thy will, O God.' "</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He first says, "Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not desire nor delight in," such as are offered according to the Law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and then he says, "Here I have come to do thy will." He takes away the first to establish the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">By this "will" we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Every priest stands daily doing service and offering many times the same sacrifices, although they never can take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But this Priest after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, took his seat at the right hand of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">for the future only waiting until his enemies are made his footstool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For by one offering he has forever perfected those who are made holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Holy Spirit testifies this to us; for after having said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts and on their minds I will write them," he adds,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">"and their sins and their law-breakings I will remember no more."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Since we have, then, brethren, confidence in entering the holy place through the blood of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">by the new and living way which he has made for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and since we have a great Priest over the house of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">let us come with true hearts in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies bathed in pure water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful who has promised,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and let us keep watch to incite one another to love and noble deeds,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">not neglecting to assemble yourselves, as some do, but encouraging one another, and so much the more, as you see the day drawing near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there remains no longer any sacrifice for sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but a dreadful expectation of doom and a fury of fire that will devour the opposers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Any one who sets aside a law of Moses dies without pity on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Of how much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy who has trampled on the Son of God, who has thought the blood of the covenant, by which it was made holy, an unholy thing, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For we know him who said, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay," and again, "The Lord will judge his people."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is dreadful to fall into the hands of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Remember the early days in which, after being enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">at one time made a public spectacle by reproaches and distresses, at another time making common cause with those who were thus treated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For you even suffered with the prisoners and accepted the plundering of your property with joy, knowing that you had a better and enduring possession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Do not, then, cast away your confidence, for it will have a great reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">You have need of patience so that after doing the will of God you may gain the promised blessing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For yet "a little, very little, while, and he who is coming will come and will not delay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">My righteous man will live by faith; but if he shrinks back, my soul has no delight in him."</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">FAITH is an assurance of things hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">By this the men of old won their fame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">By faith we understand that the worlds came into order at the word of God, so that what is now seen did not come out of things that are visible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, for which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God testifying to his gifts, and by it, though dead, he still speaks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">By faith Enoch was taken from the earth so that he did not see death, and he was not found because God had taken him. For before being taken he had this testimony that he had pleased God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But without faith it is impossible to please him. For he who comes to God must have faith that he exists and that he becomes the rewarder of those who seek him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">By faith Noah, after receiving a divine warning regarding things as yet unseen, reverently built an ark for the saving of his household. Thus he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">By faith Abraham when called obeyed and came out into the place which he was to obtain for an inheritance. He came out not knowing where he was coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">By faith he made his home in the promised land as in a foreign country, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he was looking for the city that has the foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">By faith Sarah received power to conceive a child even when past the natural time of life, since she thought him trustworthy who had given the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And so from just one man, already dead in that respect, there sprang descendants "as the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand on the seashore innumerable."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These all died in faith, not having obtained the promised blessings, but they saw them and greeted them afar and confessed that they were strangers and foreigners in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For those who say such things make it plain that they are seeking a fatherland.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And if they had been thinking of that land from which they came they would have had opportunity to return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But now they desire a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them \'97 of being called their God; for he has prepared for them a city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">By faith Abraham when he was tested offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises began offering his only son</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">regarding whom it had been said, "Those only whose descent is through Isaac shall be called your descendants."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He reasoned that God was able to raise him even from the dead, and figuratively he did win him back from the dead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">By faith Moses when he had grown up refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He chose rather to suffer hard-ship with the people of God than to enjoy the brief pleasure of sin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and he thought the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt. For he was looking to the final reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; for he endured as if seeing him who is unseen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer might not touch their first-born.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">JAMES, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the Twelve Tribes which are scattered in foreign lands: Greeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Think it all joy, my brethren, when you fall into all sorts of trials,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">since you know that the testing of your faith brings out endurance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Let endurance do its complete work, that you may be complete and perfect, lacking in nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him ask it from God, who gives to all freely without reproaching, and it will be given to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he must ask in faith with never a doubt. For he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For that man must not think that he will obtain anything from the Lord \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">a two-minded man unsteady in all his ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let the lowly brother glory in his high station,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and let the rich brother glory in his lowly station, for he will pass away like a flower of the grass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the sun rises with scorching heat and dries up the grass, and the flower of it falls and the beauty of its face perishes. So shall the rich man wither in his pursuits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when he has been tested he will gain the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">No one must say when tempted, "My temptation comes from God." For God cannot be tempted by evil, and he tempts no one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Every one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own passions and enticed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then when passion has conceived it gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Make no mistake, my beloved brethren,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">every good gift and every perfect boon is from above; it descends from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change or shadow caused by turning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Of his own will he made us his children through the message of truth, so that we might be a sort of first fruits of his creatures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I wish you to know this, my beloved brethren: Every man must be quick to hear, but slow to speak, slow to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For a man's anger does not work out God's righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So lay aside all that is vile and all that remains of malice, and receive with gentleness the implanted message which can save your souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Become doers of the message and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For if one is a hearer of the message and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">He looks at himself and is gone, and immediately forgets what sort of man he was.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">If any one thinks himself religious while he does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, that man's religion is worthless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Pure and stainless religion in the sight of God the Father is to visit orphans and widows in their trouble and to keep one's self unspotted from the world.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">If you keep the royal law according to the Scripture, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," you do well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if you have partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as law-breakers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he who keeps the whole law, but stumbles in one point, has become guilty of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For he who said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," said also, "Thou shalt not commit murder." If you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a law-breaker.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So speak and so act as those who are soon to be judged by a law of liberty.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">But some one will say, "You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith without your works and I will show you my faith by my works."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You have faith that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons have that faith, and they shudder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Are you willing to learn, O vacant-minded man, that faith without works is useless?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Was not Abraham, our father, pronounced righteous because of works when he laid Isaac his son on the altar?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was made perfect</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham had faith in God and it was credited to him for righteousness" and he was called "God's friend."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">You see that a man is pronounced righteous because of works and not because of faith alone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">In the same way was not Rahab, the prostitute, pronounced righteous because of works when she had received the messengers and sent them out by a different road?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">This wisdom does not come down from on high, but is earthly, animal, demoniacal.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">The time that has passed was enough to spend doing the will of the Gentiles, when you went on in indecencies, passions, hard drinking, revelries, carousings, and lawless idolatries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In these they think it strange that you are not running with them to the same excess of profligacy, and they slander you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they will have to give account to him who holds himself ready to judge the living and the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And for this purpose the good news was told even to the dead, that they might be judged like men in the flesh, but live as God does in the spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The end of all things is near. Therefore be serious and sober and give yourselves to prayer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Above all things have earnest love to one another, for love hides a host of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery fury that is among you, which has come to try you, as if some strange thing were happening to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But rejoice since to this extent you are sharing the sufferings of Christ, that when his glory is revealed you may rejoice and exult.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If you are reproached for the name of Christ you are blessed, for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">No one of you must suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as a wrongdoer or as a meddler in other men's affairs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But if he suffers as a Christian he should not be ashamed, but should glorify God by that name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God. And if it begins first with us, what will be the end of those who disobey the good news of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If the righteous is saved with difficulty, where will the godless and sinful appear?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So then let those who are suffering according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace be to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Since his divine power has given us all things helpful to life and piety through the knowledge of him who has called us by his own glory and virtue,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and thereby great and precious promises have been granted to us, that through them you may escape the corruption that is in the world through passion and become sharers in the divine nature,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for this very reason make it your whole endeavor to supply to your faith virtue, and to your virtue knowledge,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and to your knowledge self-control, and to your self-control endurance, and to your endurance reverence,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and to your reverence brotherliness, and to your brotherliness love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For when you have these in abundance they make you to be neither idle nor fruitless regarding the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But he who lacks these is blind, dim-sighted, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore endeavor more earnestly, brethren, to make sure that you have been called and chosen. For while doing these things you will never stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For so entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly provided for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For this reason I shall always keep reminding you of these things, although you know them and are steadfast in the truth that you have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I think it right so long as I am in this tent to arouse you by reminding you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">since I know that the laying aside of my tent will come soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made plain to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I will endeavor also on every occasion to make it so that after my going you shall have these things in memory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For we were not following cunningly devised myths when we told you of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he received from God the Father honor and glory when such words as these were borne to him from the majestic glory, "This is my Son, the Beloved; in him I delight."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this voice we heard borne from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thus have we the words of the prophets confirmed, and you will do well to give attention to them as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">since you know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from any one's private interpretation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for prophecy never came by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">BUT false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among yourselves, and they will craftily bring in deadly heresies, even disowning the Lord who bought them and bringing on themselves quick ruin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Many will follow their shameless ways and by these the path of truth will be profanely spoken of.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In covetousness they will make gain out of you by their cunning words. But their condemnation from of old has not been inactive, and their destruction has not been sleeping.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For if God did not spare angels that had sinned, but thrust them down to Tartarus and committed them to pits of darkness to be kept for judgment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and did not spare the ancient world, but guarded Noah, a herald of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought the flood on the world of the ungodly;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">for that righteous man living among them was tortured day and night in his righteous soul by the sight and hearing of their lawless deeds, \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">the Lord knows how to rescue the pious from trial and how to keep the wicked under punishment for the day of judgment,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">even where angels greater in strength and power do not bring against them an insulting charge before the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But they, like irrational creatures, born mere animals for capture and destruction, while speaking profanely of things they are ignorant of, will be corrupted by their own corruption,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and will suffer unrighteously as the reward of their own unrighteousness. They think it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are spots and blots as they revel in their deceptions while they feast sumptuously with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They have eyes engrossed with some adulteress, eyes which never cease from sin. They seduce unsteady souls. They have hearts practiced in covetousness. They are children of a curse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Leaving the straight path they have wandered away following the path of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But he was reproved for his sin; a dumb beast of draught, speaking with human voice, checked the madness of the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These men are springs without water, storm-driven mists for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For by speaking great empty swelling words they entrap in the passions of the flesh \'97 wanton excesses \'97 those who are nearly escaping from those who live in error.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">While they promise them liberty they themselves are the slaves of corruption; for by whatever any one is overcome to that he is enslaved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they have been again entangled and overcome, their last state has become worse than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment that has been committed to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">That has happened to them which the true proverb says, "The dog returns to his own vomit and the sow after bathing returns to wallowing in the mire."</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">THIS second letter, beloved, I am writing you. In both I have tried, by awakening your memory,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to arouse your honest minds to recall the predictions of the holy prophets and the commands of your apostles from the Lord and Savior.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">First you should know this, that in the last days scoffers will come with their scoffing, living according to their own passions</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and saying, "Where is his promised coming? for since the fathers fell asleep all things remain as they have been since the beginning of the creation?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For they willfully forget that there were heavens of old and an earth formed out of water and through water by God's word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">By these means the world that then was was flooded with water and destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the present heavens and the earth are by the same word treasured up and kept for fire on the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Do not forget this one thing, beloved, that one day with the Lord is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord is not slow about what he has promised, as some think of slowness, but is long-suffering toward us, wishing not to have any perish but to have all come to a change of heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. On that day the heavens will pass away with a loud noise and the burning elements will be dissolved and the earth and the things in it will not be found.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Since all of these things are to be dissolved, what sort of persons ought you to be in holy lives and piety,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">you who are looking for and hastening toward the coming of the day of God, when the blazing heavens will be dissolved and the burning elements melted?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But according to his promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness will dwell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore, beloved, since you expect this, endeavor earnestly to be found by him in peace, spotless and faultless,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and regard the long-suffering of our Lord as salvation, as also our beloved brother Paul has written to you, according to the wisdom given to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So he writes in all his letters when speaking in them of these things. In those letters are some things hard to understand, and these the unlearned and unsteady twist, as they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own ruin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You, then, beloved, since you know these things beforehand, be on your guard not to be led away by the error of the lawless and fall from your own steadfastness,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">but grow in grace and in knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory now and to the day of eternity!</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">AFTER this I looked and there was an open door in heaven and the voice that I had heard at first, as if of a trumpet speaking with me, said, "Come up here and I will show you things that must come to pass hereafter."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Immediately I became in the Spirit. A throne was standing in heaven and on the throne One was sitting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He who was sitting there was in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardius. A rainbow, in appearance like an emerald, encircled the throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Around the throne I saw twenty-four thrones and on these thrones twenty-four elders seated, clothed in white garments and with golden crowns on their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">From the throne issued lightnings and voices and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. These are the seven Spirits of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Before the throne there was as it were a glassy sea, like crystal. Near the throne and around the throne there were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man's, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The four living creatures have each six wings, and around and within they are full of eyes. They cease not saying day and night, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives for the ages of the ages,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for the ages of the ages, and they cast their crowns before the throne saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">"Worthy art thou, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for thou didst create all things and because of thy will they existed and were created."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THEN I saw in the right hand of him who was sitting on the throne a book with writing inside and outside and closely sealed with seven seals.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and loose its seals?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered and can open the book and its seven seals."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then I saw midway between the throne and the four living creatures and the elders a Lamb standing. He seemed as if he had been slain. He had seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He came and took the book from the right hand of him who was sitting on the throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When he took the book the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp and a golden bowl full of incense, which is the prayers of the holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then they sang a new song, saying, "Worthy art thou to take the book and to open its seals, for thou wast slain and didst ransom for God by thy blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and hast made them a kingdom of priests to our God, and they shall be kings on the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then I looked and I heard the voices of many angels encircling the throne and the voices of the four living creatures and of the elders \'97 the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands \'97</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">crying aloud, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And every creature that is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all creatures in them, I heard saying, "To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and power for the ages of the ages."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The four living creatures said, "Amen," and the elders fell down and worshiped.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THEN I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals and I heard one of the living creatures say, as if with a voice of thunder, "Come."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I looked and there came a white horse, and he who was sitting on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When he opened the second seal I heard the second living creature say, "Come."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then another horse came out. It was fiery red, and to him who was sitting on it was granted to take peace from the earth so that men should kill one another, and a great sword was given to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When he opened the third seal I heard the third living creature say, "Come." I looked and there came a black horse, and he who was sitting on it had a pair of scales in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I heard what seemed a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A measure of wheat for a shilling and three measures of barley for a shilling. But do no harm to the oil or the wine."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I looked and there came a pale yellow horse. The name of him who was sitting on it was Death, and Hades was following along with him. Authority was granted to them over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword and with famine and with pestilence and with the wild beasts of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the sake of God's message and because of the testimony which they had borne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Ruler holy and true, wilt thou delay to judge and take vengeance for our blood upon those who dwell on the earth?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">To each of them a white robe was given, and it was said to them that they must wait quietly yet a little while until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren was complete, who were yet to be killed as they had been.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I saw when he opened the sixth seal and there came a great earthquake and the sun became black, like sackcloth of hair, and the moon became all like blood</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and the stars of heaven fell to the ground, as a fig tree drops its unripe figs when shaken by a strong wind,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and the sky passed away like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong and every slave and freeman hid themselves in the caves and the rocks of the mountains</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and said to the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for the day, the great day, of their wrath has come and who can stand?"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">AFTER this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind might blow on the land or on the sea or on any tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, with the seal of the living God. He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been granted to harm the land and the sea</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and said, "Do not harm the land or the sea or any tree until we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed, Of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Of the tribe of Zebulon, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After this I looked and there was a great multitude which no one could count, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb clothed in white robes and with palms in their hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and they shouted with a loud voice saying, "Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb!"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">saying, "Amen. Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength be to our God for the ages of the ages! Amen."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then one of the elders spoke to me and said, "These who wear the white robes \'97 who are they and where have they come from?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I said to him, "My Lord, you know." He said to me, "These have come out of the great distress and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For this reason they are before the throne of God and worship him day and night in his Temple, and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They will not hunger any more nor thirst any more, nor will the sun strike on them nor any burning heat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for the Lamb who is in the center before the throne will be their shepherd and will lead them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">WHEN he opened the seventh seal there came a silence in heaven for about half an hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and much incense was given to him for him to put with the prayers of all the holy on the golden altar before the throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The smoke of the incense from the hand of the angel went up with the prayers of the holy before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the angel took the censer and filled it from the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth, and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The first sounded his trumpet and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees were burned up and all green grass was burned up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The second angel sounded his trumpet and, as it were, a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and a third of the creatures in the sea, those that had life, died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The third angel sounded his trumpet and there fell from heaven a great star burning like a torch. It fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the springs of water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the star is called Wormwood. Then a third of the waters became worm-wood, and many people died from the waters because they had been made bitter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The fourth angel sounded his trumpet and a blight fell upon a third part of the sun and a third part of the moon and a third part of the stars, so that a third part of them was darkened, and the day had no light for a third part of it, and the night was darkened in the same way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I looked and I heard an eagle that was flying in mid-heaven say with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to those who are living on the earth, because of the rest of the trumpet-blasts which the three angels are soon to sound!"</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THE fifth angel sounded his trumpet and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth. There was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he opened the pit of the abyss and smoke came up from the pit like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun was darkened and the air also by the smoke of the pit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given to them such as earthly scorpions have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It was said to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth nor anything green nor any tree, but only the people that did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It was not granted to them to kill such, but to torment them five months. Their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In those days men will seek for death and will not find it and will long to die, but death will fly from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The appearance of the locusts was like that of horses equipped for battle. On their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold, and their faces were like human faces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">They had hair like the hair of women. Their teeth were like those of lions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They had breastplates like breastplates of iron. The noise of their wings was like the noise of many-horsed chariots rushing into battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">They have tails as scorpions have, and stings, and with their tails they have power to harm men five months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss, whose name <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">Destroyer</NOTE></DIV> is in Hebrew Abaddon, but in Greek Apollyon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">One woe has passed. Two woes are still to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The sixth angel sounded his trumpet and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar before God</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">saying to the sixth angel with the trumpet, "Loose the four angels that are chained at the great river Euphrates."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the four angels were loosed, they who were prepared for the hour and day and month and year to kill a third of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The number of the troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This is how the horses and those who sat on them appeared to me in the vision: The riders had breastplates, fiery red, dark blue, and sulphur yellow. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and from their mouths came fire and smoke and sulphur.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">By these three plagues a third of men were killed \'97 by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur that came out of their mouths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents with heads, and with these they do injury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the rest of men, who were not killed by these plagues, neither repented of the deeds of their hands nor ceased worshiping the demons and their idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">nor did they repent of their murders nor of their magic nor of their unchastities nor of their thefts.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THEN I saw another strong angel descending from heaven. He was clothed in a cloud and the rainbow was over his head. His face was like the sun and his legs were like pillars of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He had in his hand a little book open. He set his right foot on the sea and his left on the land</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and shouted with a loud voice like the roar of a lion. When he had shouted the seven thunders spoke, each its own message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When the seven thunders had spoken I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up what the seven thunders have spoken and do not write it."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the angel whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land lifted his right hand to heaven</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and swore by him who lives for the ages of the ages, who formed heaven and all things in it and the earth and all things upon it and the sea and all things in it, "There shall be no more delay,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but in the days of the blast of the seventh angel, when he soon shall sound his trumpet, then the mystery of God has been finished, according to the good news that he gave to his servants the prophets."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke again with me and said, "Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little book. He said to me, "Take it and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, though in your mouth it will be sweet like honey."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I took the little book from the hand of the angel and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet like honey, but after I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They said to me, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings."</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THEN a reed like a measuring stick was given to me with the words, "Rise and measure the Temple of God and the altar and those who are worshiping at it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the court outside the Temple omit and do not measure it, for it has been given over to the Gentiles and they will trample down the holy city forty-two months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I will grant to my two witnesses to prophesy a thousand, two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">They are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">If any one wishes to harm them fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies. If any one shall wish to harm them, in this way he must be killed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They have power to shut up heaven so that no rain shall fall during the days that they are prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and power to smite the earth with every kind of plague as often as they please.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">When they have completed their testimony, the Beast that is coming up out of the abyss will make war with them and conquer them and kill them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Their corpses will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Men of all peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their corpses three days and a half and will not permit their corpses to be placed in a tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and send gifts to one another, because the two prophets tormented those who live on the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">After the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them and they stood on their feet. Then great fear fell on those who were looking at them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">They heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here," and they went up into heaven in the cloud while their enemies were looking at them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">At that hour occurred a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell and seven thousand men were killed by the earthquake. The rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The second Woe has passed: the third Woe will come soon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The seventh angel sounded his trumpet and there came loud voices in heaven saying, "The kingship of the world has become our Lord's and his Christ's and he will be king for the ages of the ages."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">saying, "We thank thee, Lord God Almighty, who art and wast, that thou hast taken thy great power and hast become king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Gentiles raged, but thy wrath came and the time to judge the dead and to give the reward to thy servants the prophets and to the holy who reverence thy name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who are destroying the earth."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant in his temple was seen in his temple, and there came lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hailstorm.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">A GREAT sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun. The moon was under her feet and on her head was a crown of twelve stars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">She was with child and cried out in the pangs and anguish of child-birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">There appeared also another sign in heaven, a great fiery-red Dragon with seven heads and ten horns. On his heads were seven diadems</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and his tail dragged a third of the stars of heaven and hurled them to the ground. The Dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth to a child, so that he might devour the child as soon as it was born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">She gave birth to a son who is to shepherd all the nations with a rod of iron. Then the child was caught up to God and to his throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The woman fled into the wilderness where she has from God a prepared place, that they may nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">War arose in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the Dragon. The Dragon and his angels fought,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">but they failed, and no place was found for them any longer in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then was hurled down the great Dragon, the ancient serpent who is called the Devil and Satan, who misleads the whole world \'97 he was hurled to the earth and his angels were hurled with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I heard a loud voice in heaven say, "Now has come the salvation and power and kingship of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brethren has been hurled down, he who accuses them before our God day and night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But they have conquered him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of testimony to him, and they loved not their lives even to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, rejoice, O heavens, and you who tent in them! Alas for the land and the sea! For the Devil has gone down to you in great wrath, knowing that he has but a little time."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When the Dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth he pursued the woman who had given birth to the man-child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle to fly into the wilderness to her place, where she shall be fed for a time and times and half a time, hidden from the view of the Serpent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The Serpent poured from his mouth after the woman water like a river, to sweep her away with a flood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But the earth helped the woman and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river that the Dragon had poured out of his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the Dragon was enraged against the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her offspring who keep the commands of God and hold the testimony concerning Jesus.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">THEN I stood on the sand of the sea and I saw rising out of the sea a Beast with ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten diadems and upon his heads were profane names.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Beast that I saw was like a leopard, but his feet were like a bear's feet and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The Dragon gave to him his own power and his throne and great authority.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I saw one of his heads, as it were, mortally wounded, but the mortal wound was healed. The whole world followed the Beast in amazement,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and they worshiped the Dragon because he had given such power to the Beast, and they worshiped the Beast, saying, "Who is like the Beast, and who can battle with him?"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was given to him a mouth speaking boasts and profanities, and there was given to him power to act for forty-two months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He opened his mouth to insult God, to speak profanely of his name and of his Tent and of those who tent in heaven.</VERS>
