    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after Yehoshua was born in Beit-Lechem Yehudah, in the days of Herod [the Great, the Roman "client"] king --hinei!-- chachamim <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">wise men</NOTE></DIV> from eretz Mizrach <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">the land of the East</NOTE></DIV> arrived in Yerushalayim,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">saying, "Where is he that is born Melech HaYehudim? For we have seen his KOCHAV <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">"star," BAMIDBAR 24:17</NOTE></DIV> in the Mizrach <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">East</NOTE></DIV> and have come to fall down before him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Because Herod the king heard this, he was terribly shaken, and all Yerushalayim with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And assemblying all the Rashei Hakohanim <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">Chief Priests</NOTE></DIV> and Sofrim <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">Scribes, Torah-teachers, Rabbonim</NOTE></DIV> of the people, he inquired of them the place where Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was to be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They told him, "In Beit-Lechem Yehudah; because so it stands written by the Navi:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">`And YOU, BEIT-LECHEM,<DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">"Bethlehem," MICHOH 5:1[2]</NOTE></DIV> in eretz Yehudah, are by no means least among the shtetlach <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">towns</NOTE></DIV> or ruling [clans] of Yehudah; because out of you will come a Moshel <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">Governor</NOTE></DIV> who will be the Ro'eh Ami Yisroel <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">Shepherd of my people Israel</NOTE></DIV>.`"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod secretly summoned the chachamim and ascertained from them the exact date of the manifestation of the KOCHAV.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then he sent them to Beth-Lechem, saying, "Go and make a thorough search for the yeled <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">child</NOTE></DIV>; and as soon as you have found him, report to me, so that I, as well as you, may come and fall down before him. "</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After they heard the king, they departed, and--hinei!--the KOCHAV they had seen in the Mizrach <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">East</NOTE></DIV> was going ahead of them til it came and stood above the place where the yeled was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they saw the KOCHAV, they rejoiced with exceedingly great nachas <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">joy</NOTE></DIV>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And, entering the bais <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">house</NOTE></DIV>, they beheld the yeled with Miryam his Em, and prostrated themselves before him. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And having been warned in a cholom <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">dream</NOTE></DIV> not to return to Herod, they took refuge in their own country by another way. MOSHIACH IN EGYPT</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when they'd gone, hinei, a malach Hashem appeared to Yosef Ben Dovid in a cholom <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">dream</NOTE></DIV>, saying, "Arise, and take the yeled and his Em, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is about to seek the yeled to destroy him."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So, having got up, he took the yeled, and his Em by night and departed for Mitzrayim <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">Egypt</NOTE></DIV>.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he was there until the death of Herod.  This was to fulfill what had been spoken by Hashem through the Navi, UMIMITZRAYIM KARATI LIVNI <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">"Out of Egypt have I called my Son," HOSHEA 11:1</NOTE></DIV>.  FIRST CENTURY SHOAH OF THE INNOCENTS</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When Herod saw that he had been outwitted by the chachamim, he was greatly enraged, and he ordered the slaughter of all the yeladim in Beit-Lechem and its vicinity who were two years old or under, in accordance with the time that he had learned from the chachamim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then came the fulfillment of what was spoken through Yirmeyah HaNavi:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">KOL B'RAMAH NISHMAH <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">"A voice was heard in Ramah," YIRMEYAH 31:14[15]</NOTE></DIV>, "a voice of bitter weeping and mourning.  Rachel is crying for her yeladim; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." THE EXODUS OF MOSHIACH FROM EGYPT AND HIS RETURN TO A FIRST CENTURY "SHTETL"</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When Herod died--hinei!--in Mitzrayim <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">Egypt</NOTE></DIV> a malach Hashem appeared to Yosef in a cholom <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">dream</NOTE></DIV>,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, "Arise, and take the yeled and his Em and go to Eretz-Yisroel, for those seeking the life of the yeled are dead."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Yosef arose and took the yeled and his Em, and entered Eretz-Yisroel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when Yosef heard that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Yehudah, Yosef was afraid to go there.  And, having been warned in a cholom, he departed into the districts of the Galil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Yosef made his home in the shtetl <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">Jewish community, village</NOTE></DIV> called Natzeret, so that that which was spoken by the Neviim might be fulfilled, "He will be called a Natzri." *</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now in those days Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva appears, preaching, crying out as a maggid <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">preacher</NOTE></DIV> [for the Moshiach] in the midbar <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">wilderness</NOTE></DIV> of Yehudah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">saying, "Make teshuva, for the Malchut HaShomayim has come near."</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this is the one spoken of through Yeshayah the Navi, saying, KOL KOREY BAMIDBAR <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">"A voice of one shouting in the wilderness," YESHAYAH 40:3</NOTE></DIV>: `Prepare the Derech Hashem <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">the way of the L-rd</NOTE></DIV>.

      <VERS vnumber="4">Now Yochanan himself had camel-hair clothing and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was arbe <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">locusts</NOTE></DIV> and devash <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">wild honey</NOTE></DIV>.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">But when he saw many of the Perushim and Tzedukim coming to where he was using the Yarden as a mikveh mayim, he said to them, "You yeladim of nachashim <DIV><NOTE type="x-studynote">snakes</NOTE></DIV>!
