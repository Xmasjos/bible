    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The History of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Abraham begot Isaac. Isaac begot Jacob. Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Judah had Pharez and Zarah by Tamar. Pharez begot Ezrom. Ezrom begot Aram.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Salmon had Boaz by Rahab. Boaz had Obed by Ruth. Obed begot Jesse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Jesse begot David the king. David the king had Solomon, by her who had been the wife of Uriah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Solomon begot Rehoboam. Rehoboam begot Abia. Abia begot Asa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Asa begot Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat begot Joram. Joram begot Uzziah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Hezekiah begot Manasseh. Manasseh begot Amon. Amon begot Josiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Josiah had Jeconiah and his brothers, about the time of the migration into Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After the migration into Babylon, Jeconiah begot Salathiel. Salathiel begot Zerubbabel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Zerubbabel begot Abiud. Abiud begot Eliakim. Eliakim begot Azor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Azor begot Zadoc. Zadoc begot Achim. Achim begot Eliud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Eliud begot Eleazar. Eleazar begot Matthan. Matthan begot Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jacob begot Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen; from David till the migration into Babylon, fourteen; from David till the migration into Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened thus: Mary his mother had been espoused to Joseph; but before they came together, she proved to be with child by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Joseph her husband being a virtuous man, and unwilling to expose her, intended to divorce her privately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But while he was thinking upon this, an angel of the Lord appearing to him in a dream, said, Joseph, son of David, scruple not to take home Mary your wife; for her pregnancy is from the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And she shall bear a son, whom you shall call Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">In all this what the Lord had spoken by the Prophet was verified,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">«Behold the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, who shall be called Immanuel;» 'which signifies, God with us.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When Joseph awoke, he did as the messenger of the Lord had commanded him, and took home his wife;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">but knew her not, until she had brought forth her first born son, whom he named Jesus.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After the birth of Jesus, at Bethlehem of Judea, in the reign of King Herod, certain eastern magicians came to Jerusalem, and inquired,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Where is the new-born King of the Jews; for we have seen his star in the east country, and are coming to do him homage?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">King Herod hearing this, was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And having assembled all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he demanded of them where the Messiah should be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They answered, at Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the Prophet,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">«And thou Bethlehem, in the canton of Judah, are not the least illustrious among the cities of Judah; for out of thee shall come a ruler, who will govern my people Israel.»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod having secretly called the magicians, procured from them exact information concerning the time of the star's appearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go, make an exact inquiry about the child; and when you have found him bring me word, that I may go also, and pay him homage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Having heard the King, they departed; and lo! the star which had appeared to them in the east country, moved before them, till it came, and stood over the place, where the child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they again saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And being come into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother; and, prostrating themselves, did him homage. Then opening their caskets, they offered, as presents to him, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went home another way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When they were gone, lo! a messenger of the Lord appearing to Joseph in a dream, said, Arise, take the child with his mother, and flee into Egypt; and remain there till I order you; for Herod will seek the child to destroy him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Accordingly he arose, took the child with his mother, and withdrew by night into Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">«where he continued until the death of Herod; so that, what the Lord had spoken by the Prophet, was verified,» 'Out of Egypt I called my Son.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Herod, finding that he had been deceived by the magicians, was highly incensed and dispatched emissaries who slew, by his order, all the male children in Bethlehem, and in all its territory, from those entering the second year, down to the time of which he had procured exact information from the magicians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then was the word of Jeremiah the Prophet verified,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">«A cry was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and weeping, and bitter complaint: Rachel bewailing her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord appearing in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Arise, take the child with his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Accordingly, he arose, took the child with his mother, and came to the land of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">but hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod in the throne of Judea, he was afraid to return thither; and being warned in a dream, retired into the district of Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and resided in a city named Nazareth; in this verifying the declarations of the Prophet concerning Jesus, that he should be called a Nazarene.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days appeared John the Immerser, who proclaimed in the wilderness of Judea, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Reform, for the Reign of Heaven approaches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">«For this is he, of whom the Prophet Isaiah speaks in these words,» 'The voice of one proclaiming in the wilderness, Prepare a way for the Lord, make for him a straight passage.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now John wore raiment of camel's hair with a letter girdle about his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the country along the Jordan, resorted to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But he seeing many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him to receive immersion, said to them, Offspring of vipers, who has prompted you to flee from the impending vengeance?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Produce, then, the proper fruit of reformation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and presume not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father, for I assure you, that of these stones God can raise children to Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And even now the ax lies at the root of the trees; every tree, therefore, which produces not good fruit, is cut down, and turned into fuel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I, indeed, immerse you in water, into reformation; but he who comes after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit, and in fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his grain; he will gather his wheat into the granary, and consume the chaff in unquenchable fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then came Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, to be immersed by John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But John excused himself, saying, It is I who need to be immersed by you; and you come to me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Jesus answering, said to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Permit this at present; for thus ought we to ratify every institution.</STYLE> Then John acquiesced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Jesus being immersed, no sooner arose out of the water, than heaven was opened to him; and the Spirit of God appeared, descending like a dove, and lighting upon him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">while a voice from heaven proclaimed, This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I delight.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then was Jesus conducted by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the tempter accosting him, said, If thou be God's Son, command that these stones become loaves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">«Jesus answering, said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">It is written,'Man lives not by bread only, but by everything which God is pleased to appoint.'</STYLE>»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the devil conveyed him into the holy city, and having placed him on the battlement of the temple,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">«said to him, If thou be God's Son, throw thyself down; for it is written,» 'He will give his angels the charge of thee: they shall uphold thee in their arms, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">«Jesus again answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">It is written,'Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the proof.'</STYLE>»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Again the devil took him up a very high mountain, whence he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in their glory,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and said to him, All these will I give thee, if thou wilt prostrate thyself, and worship me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">«Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Satan, begone; for it is written,'Thou shalt worship the Lord they God, and shall serve him only.'</STYLE>»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the devil leaving him, angels came and ministered to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now Jesus, hearing that John was imprisoned, retired into Galilee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and having left Nazareth, resided at Capernaum, a seaport in the confines of Zebulun and Naphtali,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">thereby verifying the words of Isaiah the Prophet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">«The canton of Zebulun and the canton of Naphtali, situate on the Jordan near the sea, Galilee of the nations;»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">the people who abode in darkness, saw a great light, and on those who inhabited a region of the shades of death, light has arisen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From that time Jesus began to proclaim, saying, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Reform, for the Reign of Heaven approaches.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon named Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea, for they were fishers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Come with me, and I will make you fishers of men.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Immediately they left the nets and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Passing on he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the bark with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They immediately, leaving the bark and their father, followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Jesus went over all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the glad tidings of the Reign, and curing every sort of disease and malady among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And his fame spread through all Syria, and they brought him all their sick, seized and tormented with various distempers, demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And vast multitudes followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from the banks of the Jordan.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Jesus, seeing so great a confluence, repaired to a mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then breaking silence, he taught them, saying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">
        <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Happy the poor who repine not; for the kingdom of heaven is theirs!</STYLE>
      </VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Forasmuch as many have undertaken to compose a narrative of those things, which have been accomplished amongst us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">as they, who were from the beginning, eye-witnesses, and afterwards ministers of the word, delivered them to us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I have also determined, having exactly traced everything from the first, to write a particular account for you, most excellent Theophilus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that you might know the certainty of those matters wherein you have been instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah; and his wife, named Elizabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They were both righteous before God, blameless observers of all the Lord's commandments and ordinances.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were advanced in years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now when he came to officiate as priest in the order of his course,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">it fell to him by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to offer incense in the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And while the incense was burning, the whole congregation were praying without.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Zacharias was discomposed at the sight, and in great terror.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias; for your prayer is heard, and Elizabeth your wife shall bear you a son, whom you shall name John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He shall be to you matter of joy and transport; and many shall rejoice because of his birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he shall be great before the Lord; he shall not drink wine nor any fermented liquor; but he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And many of the sons of Israel he shall bring back to the Lord their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover, he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children, and by the wisdom of the righteous, to render the disobedient a people well disposed for the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this: for I am old man, and my wife is advanced in years?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, who attend in the presence of God, and am sent to tell you this joyful news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But know that you shall be dumb, and shall not recover your speech, till the day when these things happen, because you have not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in due time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Meanwhile the people waited for Zacharias, and wondered that he staid so long in the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary; for he made them understand by signs, and remained speechless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when his days of officiating were expired, he returned home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Soon after, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and lived in retirement five months, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The Lord has done this for me, purposing now to deliver me from the reproach I lay under among men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now, in the sixth month, God sent Gabriel his angel, to Nazareth, a city of Galilee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">to a virgin betrothed to a man called Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">When the angel entered, he said to her, Hail, favorite of heaven! the Lord be with you, happiest of women!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At his appearance and words, she was perplexed, and revolved in her mind what this salutation could mean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And behold, you shall conceive and bear a son, whom you shall name Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God will give him the throne of David his Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever: his reign shall never end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, since I have no intercourse with man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The angel answering, said to her, The Holy Spirit will descend upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore the holy progeny shall be called the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And lo! your cousin Elizabeth also has conceived, a son in her old age; and she who is called barren, is now in her sixth month;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">for nothing is impossible with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Be it to me according to your word. Then the angel departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">In those days Mary set out, and traveled expeditiously into the hill country; to a city of Judah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">where having entered the house of Zacharias, she saluted Elizabeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's salutation, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">and cried with a loud voice, You are the most blessed of women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But how have I deserved this honor, to be visited by the mother of my Lord!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">for know, that as soon as the sound of your salutation reached my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And happy is she who believed that the things which the Lord has promised her, shall be performed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">because he has not disdained the low condition of his handmaid; for henceforth, all posterity will pronounce me happy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">For the Almighty, whose name is venerable, has done wonders for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">His mercy on them who fear him, extends to generations of generations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He displays the strength of his arm, and dispels the vain imaginations of the proud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">He pulls down potentates from their thrones, and exalts the lowly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">The needy he loads with benefits; but the rich he spoils of everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">He supports Israel his servant, ever inclined to mercy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">(as he promised to our fathers) toward Abraham and his race.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And Mary, after staying with Elizabeth about three months, returned home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">When the time for Elizabeth's delivery was come, she brought forth a son;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">and her neighbors and relations who heard that the Lord had shown her great kindness, rejoiced with her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And, on the eighth day, when they came to the circumcision of the child, they would have called him by his father's name, Zacharias.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">And his mother interposed, saying, No; but he shall be called John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">They said to her, There is none of your kindred of that name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">They, therefore, asked his father by signs, how he would have him called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">He, having demanded a table-book, wrote upon it, His name is John, which surprised them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">And his mouth was opened directly, and his tongue loosed. And he spoke, praising God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Now all in the neighborhood were struck with awe; and the fame of these things spread throughout all the hill country of Judea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">And all who heard these things, pondering them in their hearts, said, What will this child hereafter be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then Zacharias, his father, being filled with the Holy Spirit, prophesied, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited and redeemed his people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">and has raised a Prince for our deliverance in the house of David his servant;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="73">the oath which he swore to our father Abraham,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Yet the chief priests and the scribes, who were present, accused him with eagerness.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For it was necessary that he should release one to them at the festival.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for raising sedition in the city, and for murder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Pilate, willing to release Jesus, again, expostulated.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">But they persisted, demanding, with much clamor, that he might be crucified. At last, their clamors, and those of the chief priests, prevailed:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">Accordingly, he released a man who had been imprisoned for sedition and murder; whom they required; and gave up Jesus to their will.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">As they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him, that he might bear it after Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">The other, rebuking him, answered, Have you no fear of God, you who are undergoing the same punishment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And we, indeed, justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou comest to thy kingdom.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="43">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This was in the beginning with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">All things were made by him, and without him not a single creature was made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In him was life, and the life was the light of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the light shone in darkness, but the darkness received it not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">A man named John, was sent from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">This man came as a witness, to testify concerning the light, that through him, all might believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was not himself the light; but came to testify concerning the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The true light was he who, coming into the world, enlightens every man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was in the world, and the world was made by him; yet the world knew him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came to his own land, and his own people did not receive him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">but to as many as received him, believing in his name, he granted the privilege of being children of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">who derive their birth not from blood, nor from the desire of the flesh, nor from the will of man, but from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Word became incarnate, and sojourned amongst us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of favor and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">(It was concerning him John testified, when he cried, This is He of whom I said, He that comes after me, is preferred to me; for he was before me.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Of his fulness we all have received, even favor for favor's sake;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for the law was given by Moses-the favor and the truth came by Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No one ever saw God; it is the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, who has made him known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now this is the testimony of John. When the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who are you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">he acknowledged, and denied not, but acknowledged, saying, I am not the Messiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, Who, then? Are you Elijah? He said, I am not. Are you the prophet? He answered, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They said, Tell, then, who you are, that we may return an answer to them who sent us. What do you say of yourself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">«He answered, I am he whose voice proclaims in the wilderness,» 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' 'as said, the Prophet Isaiah.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now they who were sent, were of the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they questioned him further, Why, then, do you immerse, if you be not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered, I immerse in water, but there is one among you whom you know not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">It is he who comes after me, and was before me; whose shoe-string I am not worthy to loose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">This happened at Bethabara, upon the Jordan, where John was immersing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">On the next day, John sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This is He, concerning whom I said, After me a man comes, who is preferred to me; for he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">As for me, I knew him not; but, that he might be made manifest to Israel, I am come immersing in water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">John testified further, saying, I saw the spirit descending from heaven, like a dove, and remaining upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">For my part, I should not have known him, had not He, who sent me to immerse in water, told me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining, the same is He who immerses in the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Having, therefore, seen this, I testify that he is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The next day, John, being with two of his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">observed Jesus passing, and said, Behold the Lamb of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">The two disciples hearing this, followed Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Jesus turning about, saw them following, and said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">What do you seek?</STYLE> They answered, Rabbi, (which signifies Teacher,) where do you dwell?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He replied, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Come, and see.</STYLE> They went, and saw where he dwelt, and it being about the tenth hour, abode with him that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">One of the two, who, having heard John, followed Jesus, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The first he met, was his own brother, Simon; to whom he said, We have found the Messiah, (a name equivalent to Christ.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus, looking upon him, said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">You are Simon, the son of Jona; you shall be called Cephas,</STYLE> (which denotes the same as Peter.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The next day, he resolved to go to Galilee, and meeting Philip, said to him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Follow me.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip meets Nathanael, and says to him, We have found the person described by Moses in the law, and by the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Nathanael says to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip answered, Come and see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said, concerning him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Behold an Israelite, indeed, in whom is no guile.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael said to him, Whence do you know me? Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">I saw you when you were under the fig tree, before Philip called you.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael replying, said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Jesus answered him, saying, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, you believe!</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">He added, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending from the Son of Man, and descending to him.</STYLE></VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Three days after, there was a marriage in Cana, of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Jesus, also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The wine falling short, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Woman, what have you to do with me? My time is not yet come.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">His mother said to the servants, Do whatever he shall bid you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now there were six water pots of stone, containing two or three baths each, placed there for the Jewish rites of cleansing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Fill the pots with water.</STYLE> And they filled them to the brim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then he said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Draw, now, and carry to the director of the feast.</STYLE> And they did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When the director of the feast had tasted the wine made of water, not knowing whence it was, (but the servants who drew the water knew,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">he said, addressing the bridegroom, Every person presents the best wine first, and worse wine afterward, when the guests have drunk largely; but you have reserved the best till now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This first miracle Jesus wrought in Cana of Galilee, displaying his glory: and his disciples believed on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Afterward, he went to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples; but they staid not there many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the Jewish passover being nigh, Jesus went to Jerusalem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and finding changers sitting in the temple, and people who sold cattle and sheep, and doves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and cattle, scattering the coin of the changers, and oversetting their tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and he said to them, who sold doves, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Take these things hence. Make not my Father's house a house of traffic.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">«(Then his disciples remembered these words of the scripture,'My zeal for thy house consumes me.')»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore, the Jews answered, and said to him, By what miracle do you show us your title to do these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Jesus answering, said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Destroy this temple, and I will rear it again in three days.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The Jews replied, Forty and six years was this temple in building; and you would rear it in three days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(But, by the temple, he meant his body.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When, therefore, he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they understood the scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">While he was at Jerusalem, during the feast of the passover, many believed on him, when they saw the miracles which he performed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Jesus did not trust himself with them, because he knew them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He needed not to receive from others a character of any man, for he knew what was in man.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now there was a Pharisee called Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus replied, How can a grown man be born? Can he enter his mother's womb anew, and be born?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When Jesus had spoken these words, he passed, with his disciples, over the brook Kidron; where was a garden, into which he entered, and his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place; because Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Judas, having got the cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came thither with lanterns, and torches, and arms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Jesus, who knew all that was coming upon him, went forth, and said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Whom do you seek?</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They answered him, Jesus, the Nazarene. Jesus replied, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">I am he.</STYLE> Now Judas, who betrayed him, was with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He had no sooner said to them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">I am he,</STYLE> than they, going backward, fell to the ground.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus then said to Peter, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Put up the sword into the scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the cohort, and their commander, and the Jewish officers, apprehended Jesus; and having bound him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">brought him first to Annas, because he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it was Caiaphas, who had said in council to the Jews, It is expedient that one man die for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Meantime Simon Peter, and another disciple, followed Jesus. That disciple, being known to the high priest, entered his court with Jesus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the high priest interrogated Jesus concerning his disciples and his doctrine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">I spoke openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogues and in the temple, whither the Jews constantly resort. I said nothing in secret.</STYLE></VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the praetorium: it was now morning; but the Jews entered not the praetorium, lest they should be defiled, and so not in a condition to eat the passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Pilate, therefore, went out to them, and said, Of what do you accuse this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They answered, If he were not a criminal, we would not have delivered him to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Pilate said, Then take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews replied, We are not permitted to put any man to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And thus, what Jesus had spoken, signifying what death he should die, was accomplished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then Pilate returned to the praetorium, and having called Jesus, said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Do you say this of yourself, or did others tell you concerning me?</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate replied, Am I am Jew? Your own nation, yes, the chief priests have delivered you to me. What have you done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my adherents would have fought to prevent my falling into the hands of the Jews; but my kingdom is not hence.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then Pilate said, You are a King, then? Jesus answered, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">You say that I am a King. For this I was born; and for this I came into the world, to give testimony to the truth. Whosoever is of the truth, hearkens to me.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate asked him, What is truth? and so saying, went out again to the Jews, and said to them, For my part, I find nothing culpable in this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But since it is customary that I release to you one at the passover, will you that I release to you the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then they all cried, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Pilate caused him to be scourged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the soldiers crowned him with a wreath of thorn, which they had platted; and having thrown a purple mantle about him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">said, Hail! King of the Jews! and gave him blows on the face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Pilate went out again, and said to them, Lo, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find in him nothing culpable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jesus then went forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple mantle, and Pilate said to them, Behold the man!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried, saying, Crucify, crucify him! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him; for my part, I find no fault in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Jews answered, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he assumed the title of the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Pilate heard this, he was the more afraid;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and having returned to the praetorium, said to Jesus, Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Pilate said to him, Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to crucify you, and power to release you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus replied, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">You could have no power over me, unless it were given you from above; wherefore, he who delivered me to you, has greater sin.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">From that time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews exclaimed, If you release this man, you are not Cesar's friend. Whoever calls himself king, opposes Cesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Pilate, on hearing these words, ordered Jesus to be brought forth, and sat down on the tribunal, in a place named The Pavement; in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">(Now it was the preparation of the Paschal Sabbath, about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, Behold your King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they cried out, Away, away with him; crucify him. Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no King but Cesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He delivered him, therefore, to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then they took Jesus, and led him away. And he, carrying his cross, went out to a place called The Place of Skulls, which is, in Hebrew, Golgotha;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">where they crucified him, and two others with him; one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross. The words were, JESUS, THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And many of the Jews read this title, (for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh the city,) and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">then the chief priests said to Pilate, Write not the King of the Jews; but, Who calls himself King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his mantle and divided it into four parts, one to every soldier: they also took the coat, which was seamless, woven from the top throughout;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">«and said, among themselves, Let us not tear it, but determine by lot whose it shall be; by this verifying the scripture, which says,» 'They shared my mantle among them, and cast lots for my vesture.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thus, therefore, acted the soldiers. Now, there stood near the cross of Jesus, his mother, and her sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary the Magdalene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Jesus, observing his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing by, said to his mother, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Woman, behold your son.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then he said to the disciple, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Behold your mother.</STYLE> And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this, Jesus, (knowing that all was now accomplished,) that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">I thirst.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And there was a vessel there full of vinegar, they filled a sponge with vinegar, and, having fastened it to a twig of hyssop, held it to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">It is finished;</STYLE> and bowing his head, yielded up his spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews, therefore, lest the bodies should remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for it was the preparation, (and that Sabbath was a great day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and the bodies might be removed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Accordingly, the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first and of the other, who were crucified with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But when they came to Jesus, and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But one of the soldiers with a spear, pierced his side, whence blood and water immediately issued.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He was an eye-witness, who attests this, and his testimony deserves credit: nay, he is conscious that he speaks truth, that you may believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">«For these things happened that the scripture might be verified,» 'None of his bones shall be broken.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">«Again, the scripture elsewhere says,» 'They shall look on him whom they have pierced.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">After this, Joseph, the Arimathean, who was a disciple of Jesus, but a concealed disciple for fear of the Jews, asked permission of Pilate to take away the body of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Nicodemus also, who had formerly repaired to Jesus by night, came, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">These men took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen rollers, with the spices, which is the Jewish manner of embalming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now, in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, wherein no one had ever yet been laid.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And now send men to Joppa and bring hither Simon, whose surname is Peter:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">he lodges with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As soon as the messenger, who spoke to Cornelius, was gone, he called two of his domestics, and a pious soldier, of them that waited upon him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and having related to them all these things, he sent them to Joppa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">On the next day, while they were on their journey, and drew near the city, Peter went up to the top of the house to pray, about the sixth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he was hungry, and would have taken a little refreshment; but while they were preparing, he fell into an ecstasy;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and he saw heaven opened, and something descending like a great sheet, fastened at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And the voice said to him again, the second time, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Those things which God has cleansed, do not you call common.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And this was done three times, and the sheet was taken up again into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">While Peter was pondering in himself, what the vision, which he had seen, might import; behold, the men, who were sent from Cornelius, having inquired out the house of Simon, stood at the door;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and calling, they asked, if Simon, whose surname was Peter, lodged there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now, as Peter was reflecting on this vision; the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are inquiring for you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">arise, therefore, go down, and go with them without hesitation; for I have sent them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Peter went down to the men, who were sent to him from Cornelius, and said, Behold, I am the man whom you seek; what is the cause of your coming?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they said, Cornelius, the centurion, a righteous man, who fears God, and has a character attested by all the Jewish people, has been instructed, by a holy messenger, to send for you to his house, and to hear words from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Having, therefore, called them in, he entertained them, and the next day set out with them: and some of the brethren, who were of Joppa, went with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the next day they entered into Caesarea; and Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relations and intimate friends.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now, as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and prostrating himself at his feet, made obeisance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But Peter raised him up, saying, Arise; I also am a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And discoursing with him, he went in, and found many gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he said to them, You know that it is unlawful for a man that is a Jew to join with, or to come into the house of, one of another nation; nevertheless, God has shown me that I am to call no man common or unclean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Wherefore, when I was sent for, I came without debate: I ask, therefore, on what account you have sent for me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Cornelius said, Four days ago, I was fasting till this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house; and, behold, a man stood before me in bright raiment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are remembered before God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">send, therefore, to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he lodges in the house of one Simon, a tanner, by the seaside; who, when he is come, shall speak to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Immediately, therefore, I sent to you, and you have done well in coming. Now, therefore, we are all here present before God, to hear all things which God has given to you in charge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then Peter, opening his mouth, said, Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">but, in every nation, he that fears him, and works of righteousness, is acceptable to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This is that message which he sent to the children of Israel; proclaiming the glad tidings of peace by Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">You know the report there was, through all Judea, which began from Galilee, after the immersion which John preached,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">concerning Jesus of Nazareth; how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit, and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the region of the Jews, and in Jerusalem: whom they slew, hanging him on a tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">This very person God raised up, on the third day, and granted him to become manifest;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">not to all the people, but to witnesses before appointed by God, even to us, who have eat and drunk with him after he arose from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he has given in charge to us to proclaim to the people, and to testify that it is he who is appointed by God, to be the judge of the living and the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">To him all the prophets bear witness, that every one who believes on him, shall receive forgiveness of sins by his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were hearing the word:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">and they of the circumcision, who believed, as many as came with Peter, were astonished that the gift of the Spirit was poured out upon the Gentiles also:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">for they heard them speaking in diverse languages, and glorifying God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Then Peter answered, Can any one forbid water, that these persons should not be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he ordered them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. And they entreated him to continue with them several days.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the Apostles and brethren who were in Jerusalem, heard, that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they who were of the circumcision contended with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">saying, You did go in to men who were uncircumcised, and did eat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Peter beginning, opened to them the matter in order, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I was praying in the city of Joppa; and, in a trance, I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending from heaven, let down by the four corners, and it came close to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and looking attentively upon it, I observed, and saw four-footed creatures of the earth, and wild beasts, and reptiles, and fowls of the air:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and I heard a voice saying to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Arise, Peter, kill, and eat:</STYLE></VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And this was done three times. And all the things were drawn up again into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And behold, at that instant, three men were come to the house in which I was, sent from Caesarea to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the Spirit commanded me to go with them, without any scruple: and these six brethren also went along with me. And we entered into the man's house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and he told us how he had seen a messenger standing in his house, and saying to him, Send to Joppa, and bring hither Simon, whose surname is Peter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">who shall speak words to you, by which you and all your family shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as on us at the beginning.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they heard these things, they acquiesced, and glorified God; saying, God has, then, given to the Gentile also reformation to life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now, indeed, those who had been dispersed, on account of the distress which arose about Stephen, had traveled as far as Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none but Jews only.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the meantime, some, who came down from Judea, taught the brethren, Except you be circumcised, according to the manner of Moses, you can not be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There being, therefore, a contention, and no small debate with them, on the part of Paul and Barnabas; they resolved that Paul and Barnabas, and some others of their number, should go up to the Apostles and elders at Jerusalem, about this question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">They, therefore, being brought forward on their journey, by the congregation, went through Phenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles; and they occasioned great joy to all the brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And being arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the congregation, and by the Apostles and elders: and they related what things God had done with them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And after much debate, Peter rose up and said to them, Brethren, you know that, some considerable time since, God among us, chose, that the Gentiles, by my mouth, should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did to us:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">We have, therefore, sent Judas and Silas, who will also tell you by word of mouth, the same things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">The congregations, therefore, were confirmed in the faith, and increased in number daily.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">and came thence to Philippi, which is a city of the first part of Macedonia, a colony: and we continued in this city for some days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the side of the river, according to the custom, where was an oratory; and sitting down, we spoke to the women that were assembled there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, a worshiper of God, heard the discourse: whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she was immersed, with her family, she entreated us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, enter into my house, and continue there. And she compelled us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now it came to pass, that as we were going to the oratory, we were met by a certain maid-servant that had a spirit of divination, who brought her owners much gain by prophesying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">the same, following after Paul and us, cried out, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who declare to you the way of salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this she did for several days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I charge you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to go out of her. And it went out that very hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when her owners saw that the hope of their gain was gone; laying hold of Paul and Silas, they dragged them to the market place, to the magistrates:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And the populace rose up together against them; and the generals tearing off their garments, commanded them to be beaten with rods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Who, having received such a strict charge, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet fast in the stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But at midnight, Paul and Silas having prayed, sung a hymn to God: and the prisoners heard them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And, on a sudden, there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prisoner were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and the bonds of all the prisoners were loosed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the jailor, awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword, and was going to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners were fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Paul cried out, with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he called for lights, and sprung in; and, being in a tremor, fell down before Paul and Silas;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and, bringing them out, he said, O Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">And having brought them into his house, he spread the table before them: and believing in the God, with all his house, he was transported with joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Dismiss those men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the keeper of the prison told these things to Paul, The generals have sent that you may be dismissed; now, therefore, go out, and pursue your journey in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said to them, They have beaten us, who are Romans, publicly and uncondemned, and have cast us into prison; and do they now thrust us out privately? By no means: but let them come themselves, and conduct us out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the sergeants reported these words to the generals. And when they had heard that they were Romans, they were afraid:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">and they came and comforted them; and conducting them out, requested that they would depart from the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And coming out of the prison, they entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And taking their journey through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica; where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And according to Paul's custom, he entered in among them, and discoursed to them for three Sabbaths from the scriptures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">opening them, and evidently showing that the Messiah ought to suffer, and to rise from the dead; and that this is the Messiah, even Jesus, whom I declare to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And some of them believed, and adhered to Paul and Silas; besides, a considerable number of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the principal women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the unbelieving Jews, filled with zeal, gathered together some mean and profligate fellows, and making a mob, threw the city into a tumult; and assaulting the house of Jason, endeavored to bring them out to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But not finding them, they dragged Jason, and some of the brethren to the magistrates of the city, crying out, These men, that have turned the world upside down, are come hither, also;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and Jason has privately received them. And all these men act contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they alarmed the multitude and the magistrates of the city, when they heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And having taken security of Jason, and the rest, they dismissed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas, by night, to Berea: and when they came thither, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now these were of a more noble disposition that those of Thessalonica: for they received the word with all readiness of mind, daily examining the scriptures, whether those things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Many of them, therefore, believed; both of the Grecian women of considerable rank, and of the men not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But as soon as some of the Jews of Thessalonica understood that the word of God was announced by Paul at Berea, they came thither, also, exciting the populace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, as if he were to go by sea. But Silas and Timothy continued there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens: and having received an order for Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him as soon as possible, they set out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now, while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit within him was strongly moved when he beheld the city enslaved to idolatry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He therefore reasoned with the Jews and proselytes in the synagogue; and in the forum, daily, with those who met with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers opposed him. Others said, What would this babbler say? And others, he seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities; because he declared to them the good news concerning Jesus and the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they took him and conducted him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, which is spoken by you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">for you bring some strange things to our ears; we would, therefore, know what these things mean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For all the Athenians, and the strangers that sojourned among them spent their leisure in nothing else but in telling or hearing news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Paul, therefore, standing up in the middle of Areopagus, said, Athenians, I perceive that you are exceedingly addicted to the worship of demons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For, as I passed along, and beheld the objects of your worship, I found an altar with this inscription, To the Unknown God: Him, therefore, you ignorantly worship, I announce to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The God who made the world, and all things that are in it, being the Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Neither is he served by human hands, as if he stood in need of anything; he himself giving to all, life, and breath, and all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he has made of one blood, the whole race of men, to inhabit all the face of the earth; having marked out the times previously arranged in order, and the boundaries of their habitations:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">that they might seek after the Lord, if possibly they might feel after him, and find him; though he be not far from every one of us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">«for in him we live, and are moved, and do exist; as some of your own poets have said-For we his offspring are.»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">We, therefore, being the offspring of God, ought not to imagine the Deity to be like gold, or silver, or stone, wrought by the art and contrivance of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For though God overlooked the times of ignorance, he now makes proclamation to all men, everywhere, to reform;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world righteously, by that Man whom he has ordained: of which he has given assurance to all men, by raising him from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some made a jest of it, and others said, We will hear you again upon this subject.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And this Paul went out of the midst of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Nevertheless, some men adhered to him, and believed: among whom was Dionysius, the Areopagite; also a woman, whose name was Damaris; and others with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and finding a certain Jews, named Aquila, a native of Pontus, lately come from Italy, with Priscilla, his wife, (because Claudius Cesar had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome,) he went to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And as he was of the same trade, he continued with them, and wrought; for by trade they were tent-makers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath day, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as soon as Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul was impelled by the Spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when they set themselves in opposition, and reviled, he shook his garment, and said to them, Let your blood be upon your own head! I am pure. From henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And going out thence, he went into the house of one called Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now, Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, with all his house; and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed; and were immersed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">saying, This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when Paul would have opened his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were an act of injustice, or mischievous licentiousness, O Jews! it were reasonable I should bear with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if it be a question concerning words, and names, and the law which is among you, you see to it yourselves; for I will be no judge of these matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drove them away from the tribunal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the tribunal; but Gallio did not concern himself at all about the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Paul still continued there for a considerable time, and then taking leave of the brethren, sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shaved his head at Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he arrived at Ephesus, and there he left them; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And though they entreated him to have staid longer with them, he did not consent:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">but he took his leave of them, saying, It is necessary for me, all means, to celebrate the approaching feast at Jerusalem; but I will return to you again, God willing. And he set sail from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And landing at Caesarea, he went up; and having saluted the congregation, he went down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">and having saluted the congregation, he went down to Antioch. And having spent some time there, he departed, going through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, in a regular manner confirming all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now, a certain Jew, whose name was Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, and powerful in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This person was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught them things of the Lord with great accuracy, being only acquainted with the immersion of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla hearing him, took him aside, and explained to him the way of God in a more perfect manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when he intended to go over to Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples, exhorting them to receive him. And being arrived there, by his gift he greatly helped those who had believed.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper parts, came to Ephesus: and finding there some disciples,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said to them, Into what, then, were you immersed? And they said, Into John's immersion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Paul said, John, indeed, administered the immersion of reformation, telling the people that they should believe in Him that was to come after him: that is, in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And hearing this, they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Paul, laying his hands, on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they were, in all, about twelve men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he went into the synagogue, and discoursed with boldness, disputing for the space of three months, and evincing the things which related to the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But as some were hardened, and would not believe, speaking reproachfully of this way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this was done for the space of two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God wrought extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that handkerchiefs, or aprons, were carried from his body to those who were sick, and the diseases removed from them, and the evil spirits came out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And some of the strolling Jews, who were exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus, over those who had evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preaches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the evil spirit answering, said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man in whom the evil spirit was, sprung upon them, and getting master of them prevailed against them, so that they fled out of the house, naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this was known to all the Jews, and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And many of them, who believed, came and confessed, and made a declaration of their deeds.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">whom he gathered together, with the workmen employed about the business, and said, Men, you know that our maintenance arises from this manufacture;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and you see and hear that this Paul has persuaded great numbers of people, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, and has turned them aside, saying that they are not deities which are made with hands;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">so that there is danger, not only that this occupation of ours should be depreciated, but also that the people of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her grandeur destroyed; whom all Asia and the world worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And hearing this, they were filled with rage; and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the whole city was filled with confusion; and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging thither Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's fellow-travelers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when Paul would have gone in to the people, the disciples would not permit him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And some, too, the principal officers of Asia, as they had a friendship for him, sent to him, and desired that he would not venture himself into the theater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Some, therefore, were crying one thing, and some another; for the congregation was confused, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they thrust forth forward Alexander, from amongst the multitude, the Jews urging him on. And Alexander, beckoning with his hand, would have made a defense to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when they knew that he was a Jew, one voice arose from them all, crying out, for about the space of two hours, Great is Diana of the Ephesians!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But the chancellor, having pacified the people, said Ephesians, what man is there that does not know that the city of the Ephesians is devoted to the great Diana, and to the image that fell down from Jupiter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Since, then, these things are incontestable, it is necessary for you to be quiet, and to do nothing in a precipitate manner;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">for you have brought these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of your goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">If, therefore, Demetrius, and the artificers that are with him, have a charge against any one, courts are held; and there are the proconsuls; let them implead together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if you are inquiring anything concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a legal congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And, indeed, we are in danger of being called in question for the insurrection which has happened this day, as there is no cause by which we can account for this concourse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he had said these things, he dismissed the congregation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now, after the tumult was ceased, Paul, calling the disciples to him: and embracing them, departed to go into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And going through those parts, and having exhorted them with much discourse, he came into Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when he had continued there three months, as an ambush was laid for him by the Jews, when he was about to embark for Syria, he thought it advisable to return by Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Sopater, the Berean, accompanied him as far as Asia; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius, of Derbe, and Timothy: and of the Asiatics, Tychicus and Trophimus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">These, going before, staid for us at Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And we set sail from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we continued seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And on the first day of the week, when the disciples met together to break bread, Paul, being about to depart on the morrow, discoursed to them, and continued his speech until midnight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there were many lamps in the upper room, in which we were assembled;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and a certain young man, whose name was Eutychus, sitting in a window, fell into a profound sleep: and as Paul continued his discourse a long time, he was so overpowered with sleep that he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Paul went down, and fell upon him, and taking him in his arms, said, Do not make any disturbance, for his life is in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And going up again, and having broken bread, and eaten, he conversed a considerable time, even till break of day, and so departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they brought the youth alive, and were not a little comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we went before into the ship, and sailed to Assos, where we are to take up Paul, for so he had appointed, choosing himself to go on foot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And as soon as he joined us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And sailing thence, we came the next day over against Chios; and the day following, we touched at Samos, and having staid at Trogyllium, we came the day after to Miletus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not spend any time in Asia; for he earnestly endeavored, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But, sending to Ephesus, from Miletus, he called thither the elders of the congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they were come to him, he said to them, You know how I have been conversant among you all the time, from the first day in which I entered into Asia,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">testifying both to the Jews and Greeks, reformation with respect to God, and faith with respect to our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound by the Spirit, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But I make no account of any of these things, nor do I regard even life itself; so that I may but joyfully finish my course, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, even to testify the good news of the favor of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And now, behold, I know that you all, with whom I have conversed, proclaiming the kingdom of God, shall not see my face any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Wherefore, I testify to you this day, that I am clear from the blood of all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For I have not declined to declare to you all the counsel of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore, take heed to yourselves, and to the whole flock over which the Holy Spirit has constituted you overseers; to feed the congregation of the Lord, which he has redeemed with his own blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For I know this, that after my departure, grievous wolves will enter in among you, having no mercy on the flock.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Yes, from among your own selves men shall arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Watch, therefore, remembering that for the space of three years, I ceased not to warn every one, night and day, with tears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And now, brethren, I recommend you to God, and to the word of his favor, who is able to edify you, and to give you an inheritance among all that are sanctified.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">And having said these things, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And there was great lamentation among them all: and falling upon Paul's neck, they kissed him;</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now, as soon as we had withdrawn from them, and had set sail, we came with a direct course to Coos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And finding a ship passing over Phenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And coming within sight of Cyprus, and leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its freight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And we continued there several days, finding disciples, who told Paul, by the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But when we had finished these seven days, we departed, and went our way, and they all attended us out of the city, with their wives and children; and, kneeling down on the seashore, we prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And having embraced each other, we went on board the ship; and they returned back to their own houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And finishing our course, we came from Tyre to Ptolemais, and embracing the brethren, we continued with them one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And on the next day we departed, and came to Caesarea, and entering into the house of Philip, the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we lodged with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now he had four virgin daughters, who were prophetesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And as we continued there many days, a certain prophet, whose name was Agabus, came down from Judea:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and coming to us, he took up Paul's girdle, and binding his own hands and feet, he said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose girdle this is, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when we heard these things, both we, and the inhabitants of that place, entreated him, that he would not go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Paul answered, What do you mean, thus weeping, and breaking my heart? for I am ready, not only to be bound; but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased; saying, The will of the Lord be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And after these days, making up our baggage, we went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And some of the disciples also from Caesarea, went along with us, and brought us to one Mnason, a Cyprian, and old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when we were arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren received us with pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the next day Paul entered in with us to James; and all the elders were present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And having embraced them, he gave them a particular account of those things which God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when they heard it, they glorified God, and said to him, Brother, you see how many myriads of believing Jews there are: and they are all zealous for the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now, they have been informed of you, that you teach all the Jews, which are among the Gentiles, to apostatize from Moses, saying, that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">What is it then? The multitude must, by all means, come together; for they will hear that you are come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore, do this that we say to you: there are with us four men who have a vow upon them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">take them, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all will know that there is nothing in those things which they have heard of you; but that you yourself walk regularly, keeping the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">As for the believing Gentiles, we have written, determining that they should observe none of these things; except it be to keep themselves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from that which is strangled, and from fornication.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Paul took the men, and the next day, being purified with them, entered into the temple, declaring the accomplishment of the days of purification, till an offering should be offered for every one of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But as the seven days were about to be accomplished, the Jews that were from Asia, seeing him in the temple, threw all the populace into confusion, and laid hands upon him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">crying out, Israelites, help! This is the man that everywhere teaches all men contrary to the people, and to the law, and to this place; and has even brought Greeks into the temple, and polluted this holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">(For they had been seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, in the city with him, whom they imagined that Paul had brought into the temple.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people; and laying hold of Paul, they dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the gates were shut.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they went about to kill him, word was brought to the commander of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in confusion:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">who immediately took soldiers, and centurions, and ran in among them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they ceased from beating Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the commander drew near, and took him; and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was, and what he had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And some among the multitude cried out one thing, and some another: and as he could not know the certainty, by reason of the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But when he was upon the stairs, it came to pass that he was borne by the soldiers, because of the violence of the crowd.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For the multitude of the people followed, crying out, Away with him!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But as Paul was going to be brought into the castle, he said to the commander, May I be allowed to speak to you? And he said, Can you speak Greek?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Are you not that Egyptian, who did, before these days, stir up a sedition, and led out into the wilderness four thousand murderers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But Paul said, I am indeed a Jew, of Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no inconsiderable city; and I entreat you, permit me to speak to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And on his giving permission, Paul standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people; and when there was a great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew dialect, saying:</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Brethren and fathers, hear my apology, which I make to you now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they heard, that he addressed them in the Hebrew dialect, they rather kept silence;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and he said, I am, indeed, a Jew, born at Tarsus, in Cilicia, but educated in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, accurately instructed in the law of our fathers; being zealous for God, as you all are at this day:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who persecuted this way to the death; binding both men and women, and delivering them into prisons:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">as also the high priest is my witness, and all the national senate: from whom also having received letters to the brethren, I went to Damascus; to bring those that were there bound, to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, that as I was on my journey, and was come nigh to Damascus, about noon, on a sudden a great light from heaven shone about me;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you persecute.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they that were with me saw the light, indeed, and were terrified; but they did not distinctly hear the voice of him that spoke to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I said, Lord, what shall I do? And the Lord said to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Arise, and go to Damascus, and there it shall be told you of all things, which are appointed for you to do.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as I could not see, by reason of the glory of that light; being led by those that were with me, I came to Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And one Ananias, a pious man according to the law, who had an honorable character amongst all the Jews at Damascus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">coming to me, and standing by me, said to me, Brother Saul, look up. And in that very hour, I looked up on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, The God of our fathers, has chosen you to know his will, and to see that righteous person, and to hear a voice from his mouth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">because you shall be his witness, to all men, of those things, which you have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And now, why do you delay? Arise, and be immersed, and wash away your sins, invoking his name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, that when I was returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, I was in a trance:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and I saw him, saying to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Make haste, and depart quickly from Jerusalem; for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said, Lord, they know I was imprisoning, and scourging in the synagogues, them that believed in thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and when the blood of Stephen thy martyr was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and kept the garments of those who slew him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And they heard him to this word, and they lifted up their voices, saying, Away with this fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he should live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as they were crying out, and were rending their garments, and casting dust into the air,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">the commander ordered that he should be brought into the castle, saying, that he should be put to the question by scourging, that he might know for what cause, they raised such an outcry against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as they binding him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion, who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man, who is Roman, and uncondemned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the centurion hearing this, went and addressed the commander, saying, What are you about to do? for this man is a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the commander came, and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the commander answered, I obtained this freedom with a considerable sum of money. And Paul replied, But I was free born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">They, therefore, who were about to have put him to the question, immediately departed from him: and the commander was afraid, when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And on the next day, desiring to know certainly of what he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him; and commanded the chief priests, and all the Sanhedrim, to come together; and bringing Paul down, he set him before them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Paul, looking attentively on the Sanhedrim, said, Brethren, I have, even to this day, lived in all good conscience toward God-</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Paul said to him, God is about to strike you, you whited wall! For do you sit to judge me according to the law, and yet, in violation of the law, command me to be struck?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But they, that stood by, said, Do you revile the high priest of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">«And Paul said, Brethren, I was not aware that it was the high priest; for it is written,» 'You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Paul, perceiving that the one part was Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out, in the Sanhedrim, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope and resurrection of the dead, I am brought into judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And on speaking this, there was a contention between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there was a great clamor; and the scribes who were on the side of the Pharisees, arose and contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit, or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And as a great disturbance arose, the commander, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to go down, and take him by force from the midst of them, and to bring him into the castle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And in the following night, the Lord, standing by him, said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Be of good courage, Paul; for as you have testified the things concerning me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear testimony in Rome.</STYLE></VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">The commander, therefore, dismissed the young man, with a charge, Be sure you tell no man, that you have discovered these things to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he called too him two of the centurions, and said, Prepare two hundred soldiers, to go to Caesarea; and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen; by the third hour of the night;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And, desiring to know the crime of which they accused him, I brought him before the Sanhedrim,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">for we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world; and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who has attempted to profane the temple; and whom we apprehended, and would have judged according to our law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but Lysias, the commander, coming upon us with a great force, took him away out of our hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">commanding his accusers to come to you; by which means, you may yourself, on examination, know the certainty of all these things, of which we accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Jews also gave their assent, saying, that these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Paul, after the governor had made a signal to him to speak, answered, Knowing that you, O Felix! have been for several years a judge to this nation, I answer for myself with the more cheerfulness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">since you may know that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and they neither found me disputing with any man in the temple, nor making any insurrection among the people, either in the synagogues, or in the city:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">nor can they produce any proof of the things concerning which they now accuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call a sect, so worship I the God of our fathers; believing all things which are written in the law, and in the prophets;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">having hope toward God, of that which they themselves also expect, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And upon this account, I exercise myself to have always a conscience without offense toward God, and toward men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now, after several years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">upon which some Asiatic Jews found me purified in the temple; neither with multitude nor with tumult;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who ought to have been present before you, and to accuse me, if they had anything against me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">or let these themselves say, if, when I stood before the Sanhedrim,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">they found any crime in me; unless it be with relation to this one word, which I expressed, when I stood among them-that, for the resurrection of the dead, I am judged by you this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when Felix heard these things, he put them off, saying, After I have been more accurately informed concerning this way, when Lysias, the commander, comes down, I will take cognizance of the affair between you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul, and let him have liberty, and to hinder none of his friends from assisting him, or coming to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And, after some days, Felix, coming the Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he reasoned concerning righteousness and temperance, and judgment to come, Felix, trembling, answered, Go your way for this time, and I will take some future opportunity to call for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he hoped, also, that money would be given him by Paul, that he might be set at liberty: and, therefore, he sent the more frequently for him, and discoursed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now, after two years were ended, Felix was succeeded by Portius Festus; and Felix, willing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, left Paul a prisoner.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When Festus, therefore, was come into the province, after three days, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and the high priest, and the chief among the Jews, appeared before him against Paul, and entreated him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">that he would send for him to Jerusalem; laying an ambush to kill him by the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would shortly set out for that place:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">therefore, said he, Let those of you who are able, go down with me; and if there be anything criminal in this man, let them accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And, having continued among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and the next day, sitting down on the tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he appeared, the Jews, who came down from Jerusalem, stood round about, bringing many heavy accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">while he answered for himself-Neither against the laws of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cesar, have I committed any offense at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, willing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, answered Paul, and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged before me, concerning these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But Paul said, I am standing at Cesar's tribunal, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you know perfectly well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For, if, indeed, I have done wrong, or have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if there is no fact of which they accuse me, no man can give me up to gratify them! I appeal to Cesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Festus, having spoken with the council, answered, Have you appealed to Cesar? To Cesar you shall go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when some days were passed, King Agrippa, and Bernice, came to Caesarea, to pay their respects to Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And as they continued there many days, Festus laid before the king the case of Paul, saying, There is a certain man, left in bonds by Felix;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">concerning whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews, informed me, desiring judgment against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, till he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and be allowed an opportunity of making his defense, as to the crime laid to his charge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When, therefore, they were come hither, I, without any delay, sat down on the tribunal next day, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">but had certain questions against him, relating to their own religion, and about one Jesus, that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But as I was dubious of the question relating to him, I said, that if he were willing, he should go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Paul, appealing to be kept to the hearing of his majesty, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Cesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Agrippa said to Festus, I also would willingly hear the man myself. And he said, To-morrow you shall hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The next day, therefore, Agrippa and Bernice, coming with great pomp, and entering into the place of audience, with the commanders and principal men of the city; at the command of Festus, Paul was brought forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all you who are present with us! you see this man, concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews have pleaded with me, both at Jerusalem, and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But I could not apprehend him to have done anything worthy of death; yet, as he himself has appealed to his majesty, I have determined to send him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Concerning whom I have nothing certain to write to my master: wherefore, I have brought him out before you all; and especially before you, King Agrippa! that, after examination taken, I may have something to write:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">for it seems to me absurd, to send a prisoner, and not to signify the crimes alleged against him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Agrippa said to Paul, It is granted to you to speak for yourself. Then Paul, stretching forth his hand, made his defense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I esteem myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am this day to make my defense before you, concerning all those things of which I am accused by the Jews;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">especially as you are acquainted with all the customs and questions among the Jews: wherefore, I entreat you, that you will hear me with patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The manner of my life, from my youth, which, from the beginning, was spent among my own nation, in Jerusalem, is known to all the Jews;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">who knew me from the first, (if they would testify,) that, according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now I stand in judgment for the hope of that promise, which was made by God to our fathers:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">to which promise, our twelve tribes, worshiping continually, night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why should it be judged an incredible thing, by you, that God should raise the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I, indeed, thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Which, accordingly, I did in Jerusalem; and I shut up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the chief priests. And when some of them were killed, I gave my vote against them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and frequently punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme: and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">With this view, I was going to Damascus, with authority and commission from the chief priests;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">at mid-day, on the road, King Agrippa, I saw a light from heaven, exceeding the splendor of the sun, shining about me, and those who traveled with me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">I am Jesus, whom you persecute.</STYLE></VERS>

      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">From that time, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">but declared, first to them at Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judea; and then to the Gentiles, that they should reform, and return to God, performing deeds worthy of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">On account of these things, the Jews seizing me in the temple, attempted to have killed me with their own hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Having, therefore, obtained help from God, I continue, till this day, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses have declared would be;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And as he was thus making his defense, Festus said, with a loud voice, Paul, you are distracted: much learning drives you to madness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But he replied, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but utter the words of truth and soberness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For the king knows of these things; to whom, also, I speak with freedom: for I am persuaded none of these things are hid from him, for this was not done in a corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa! do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Agrippa said to Paul, You almost persuade me to be a Christian.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="27">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And as it was determined that we should set sail into Italy, they delivered Paul, and some other prisoners, to a centurions of the Augustan Band, whose name was Julius.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And going on board a ship of Adramyttis, we weighed anchor, intending to sail by the coasts of Asia; Aristarchus, a Macedonian, of Thessalonica, being with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the next day we reached Sidon: and Julius, treating Paul with great humanity, permitted him to go to his friends, and to enjoy the benefit of their care.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And weighing anchor thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And sailing through the sea over against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there, the centurion, finding a ship of Alexandria, bound for Italy, put us on board of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when we had sailed slowly for several days, and were hardly got over against Cnidus, the wind now permitting us; we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and passing it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called the Fair Havens, in the neighborhood of which, was the city of Lasea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And, as much time was spent, and sailing was now hazardous, because the fast was already over, Paul exhorted them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">saying to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be attended with injury and great damage, not only to the lading and to the ship, but also to our lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the centurion paid greater regard to the pilot, and the master of the vessel, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And as the haven was not commodious to winter in, the greater part advised to set sail from thence, if they might possibly reach Phenice, to winter there;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">which is a haven of Crete, looking to the southwest and northwest: and as the south win blew gently, supposing they were secure of their purpose, they weighed anchor, and sailed on close to Crete.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But not long after, there arose against her a tempestuous wind, which is called Euroclydon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as the ship was violently hurried away, and was not able to bear up against the wind, we gave her up, and were driven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">An running under a certain island, called Clauda, we were hardly able to get masters of the boat:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">and the third day we cast out, with our own hands, the tackling of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now, as neither sun nor stars appeared for several days, and no small tempest pressed upon us, all remainder of hope that we might be delivered, was taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when there was great want of food, then Paul, standing in the midst of them, said, Sirs, you ought to have hearkened to me, and not to have loosed from Crete, and incurred this injury and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Nevertheless, even now I exhort you to be of good courage: for there shall be no loss of any life among you; but only of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For there appeared to me this night, an angel of the God whose I am, and whom I worship,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be presented before Cesar; and, behold, God has given you all them that sail with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Wherefore, take courage, men; for I trust in God that it shall be so, even as it was told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But we must be cast upon a certain island.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were tossed up and down in the Adriatic sea, the mariners suspected, about midnight that they drew near to some land;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and sounding, they found it twenty fathoms: and having gone a little way from thence, and sounding again, they found it fifteen fathoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And fearing lest they should fall upon some rocky shore, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished that the day would break.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But when the mariners endeavored to flee out of the ship, and had let down the boat into the sea, under pretense that they were about to carry out anchors from the ship-head;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these continue in the ship, you can not be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut off the cords of the boat, and let it fall off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take some food, saying, Today, whilst waiting for this fourteenth day, you continue fasting, having taken nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">I exhort you, therefore, to take a refreshment; for this is conducive to your safety: for not a hair shall fall from the head of any of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when he had spoke thus, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God, before them all; and having broken it, he began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And being all encouraged, they also took some food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And we were in the ship, in all two hundred and seventy-six souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And being satisfied with food, they lightened the ship; and cast the corn into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when it was day, they did not know the land: but they perceived a certain creek, with a shore, into which they determined, if they were able, to force the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And having cut off the anchors, leaving them in the sea, they, at the same time, loosing the rudder bands, and hoisting up the mainsail to the wind, pressed toward the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">But falling on a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground, and the fore part stuck fast, and remained immovable, while the hinder part was broken by the force of the waves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the counsel of the soldiers was, that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim away, and escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the centurion, being desirous to save Paul, hindered them from their purpose, and commanded those that could swim, to throw themselves out first, into the sea, and get away to land:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">and the remainder, some upon planks, and others upon some of the things of the ship. And so it happened that they all got safe to land.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And being got safe to land, they then knew that the island was called Melita.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the barbarians treated us with uncommon humanity; for having kindled a fire, they brought us all to it, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now, as Paul was gathering up a bundle of sticks, and laying them on the fire, a viper coming out of the heat, fastened upon his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as soon as the barbarians saw the fierce animal hanging on his hand, they said one to another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom justice has not permitted to live, though he be saved from the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But he, shaking off the fierce animal into the fire, suffered no evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">However, they expected that he should have swollen, or suddenly have fallen down dead: and having waited a considerable time, and seeing no mischief befall him, changing their minds, they said he was a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And in the neighborhood of that place, there was the estate of the chief of the island, whose name was Publius; who, having received us into his house, entertained us in a courteous manner for three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And so it was, that the father of Publius, being seized with a fever and bloody flux, was confined to his bed: to whom Paul going in, and having prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now, therefore, when this miracle was wrought, the rest also, who had disorders, in the island, came, and were healed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Who also honored us with great honors; and when we departed, put on board such things as were necessary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after three months, we departed in a ship of Alexandria, that had wintered in the island, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And being arrived at Syracuse, we continued there three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From thence we coasted round, and came over against Rhegium. And after one day the south wind arising, we came, in two days, to Puteoli:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">where we found brethren, and were entreated to stay with them seven days: and so we went for Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And from thence, the brethren, having heard of our affairs, came out to meet us, as far as Appii Forum, and the Three Taverns: whom, when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the band: but Paul was permitted to dwell apart, in a house of his own, with a soldier that guarded him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, that, after three days, Paul called together those that were the chief of the Jews. And when they were come together, he said to them, Brethren, though I have done nothing contrary to the people, nor to our paternal customs, yet I was delivered a prisoner, from Jerusalem, into the hands of the Romans;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who, having examined me, were willing to have set me at liberty, as there was no cause of death in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when the Jews opposed, I was obliged to appeal to Cesar; not as having anything of which to accuse my own nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For this reason, therefore, I entreated, that I might see and speak with you; for on account of the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you; nor have any of the brethren, that have come hither, related, or said, any evil concerning you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But we desire to hear from you, what you think; for as concerning this sect, we know that it everywhere spoken against.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And having appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them of the things that relate to Jesus; both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning till evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some were persuaded by the things which were spoken; and some believed not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And disagreeing with each other, they broke up the assembly: Paul saying this one word, Surely, well did the Holy Spirit speak, by Isaiah the prophet, to our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">«when he said,» 'Go to this people and say, Hearing you will hear, and will not understand; and seeing you will see, and will not perceive:'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">«for the heart of this people is become gross, and with their ears they hear heavily; and they have drawn their eyes together, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore be it known to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having great debates among themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But Paul continued two whole years in his own hired house, and received all who came to him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">announcing the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which relate to the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, and without any restraint.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">and that I may be comforted, together with you, through the mutual faith both of you and me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now, brethren, I would not have you ignorant, that I often purposed to come to you, thought I have, as yet been hindered; that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the other Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am a debtor, both to the Greeks and to the barbarians; both to the wise and to the unwise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore, I am willing, according to my ability, to declare the glad tidings, even to you who are in Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel; because it is the power of God for salvation, to every one who believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">«For in it the justification of God by faith is revealed, in order to faith; as it is written,» 'Now the just by faith, shall live.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Because that which may be known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested it to them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">(for his invisible attributes, even his eternal power and divinity, since the creation of the world, are very evident; being known by his works:) so that they are inexcusable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because, though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God, neither gave him thanks; but became foolish by their own reasonings, and their inconsiderate heart was darkened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Professing to be wise men, they became fools:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">for they changed the glory of the immortal God into the likeness of an image of mortal man, of fowls, or four-footed beasts, and of reptiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore, also, God, through the lusts of their own hearts, delivered them over to uncleanness, to dishonor their own bodies among themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Who changed the truth concerning God, into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature, rather than the Creator, who is forever blessed. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For this, God delivered them over to shameful passions; for even their females changed the natural use unto what is contrary to nature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">In like manner, also, the males, leaving the natural use of the female, burned in their lust toward one another, males with males, working out that which is shameful, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And as they did not like to acknowledge God, God delivered them over to an undiscerning mind, to work those things which are not suitable;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And do you think this, O man, who condemn those who practice such things, and yet do the same, that you shall escape the sentence of God?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And he received the mark of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he had whilst uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all uncircumcised believers, that righteousness might be counted even to them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For the promise to Abraham, that he should be the heir of a world, was not to him, nor to his seed, through law; but through a righteousness of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if they who are of law are heirs; faith is rendered vain, and the promise is made of no effect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Farther, the law works out wrath; but where law is not, there is no transgression.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For this reason, it is through faith that it might be by favor, that the promise might be sure to all the seed: not to that only which is of the law; but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">«(as it is written,'Surely a father of many nations have I constituted you,') in the presence of him whom he believed, even of God, who makes alive the dead, and calls things which exist not, as though they existed.»</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And this hope makes not ashamed: because the love of God is diffused in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, that is given us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Besides, we being yet weak, in the appointed time Christ died for the ungodly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now, scarcely for a just man will one die, though for a good man one would, perhaps, even dare to die.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And not only so, but we even rejoice in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, though whom we have now received reconciliation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Wherefore, as sin entered into the world by one man, in whom all sinned, and by sin, death: thus death came upon all men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">But not as the offense, so also is the free gift: for if by the offense of the one, the many died; much more the favor of God, and the gift by favor, which is of the one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to the many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And not as through one who sinner, is the free gift: for the sentence was from one to condemnation; but the free gift is from many offenses to justification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For if by the offense of the one, death reigned by the one; much more shall they who receive the abundance of favor, and of the gift of justification, reign in life, by the one-Jesus Christ.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now, therefore, as through one offense, the sentence came upon all men to condemnation: so, also, by one act of obedience, the sentence came upon all men to justification of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For, as through the disobedience of the one, the many were constituted sinners; so, by the obedience of the one, the many shall be constituted righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Moreover, the law supervened, that the offense might abound; but where sin abounded, favor superabounded-</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">But the mind of the flesh is death; and the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">because the mind of the flesh is enmity toward God: for, to the law of God it is not subject; neither, indeed, can be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Those, then, who are in the flesh, can not please God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now, you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit; because the Spirit of God dwells in you. But, if any one have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And if Christ be in you, the body, indeed, is dead, with respect to sin; but the Spirit is life, with respect to righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For, if the Spirit of him, who raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he who raised up Christ from the dead, will make even your mortal bodies alive, through his Spirit, who dwells in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Well, then, brethren, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Wherefore, if you live according to the flesh, you shall die; but if, through the Spirit, you put to death the deeds of the body, you shall live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Because, as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For you have not received the spirit of bondage, again, to fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Also this spirit bears witness, together with our spirit, that we are children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if children, then heirs; heirs, indeed, of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if, indeed, we suffer with him, that with him also we may be glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">However, I esteem not the sufferings of the present time, as worthy of comparison with the glory, which is hereafter to be revealed in us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the earnest expectation of the creature, is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the creature was subjected to frailty, (not of its own choice, but by him who has subjected it,) in hope,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">that it may be liberated, from the bondage of a perishing state, and brought into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Besides, we know, that the whole creation sigh together, and travail in anguish till the present time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first fruit of the Spirit; even we ourselves, groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption; namely, the redemption of our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For even we are saved by hope. Now, hope that is attained, is not hope; for who can hope for that which he enjoys?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But if we hope for that which we do not enjoy, then, with patience, we wait for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">In like manner, also, the Spirit helps our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for, as we ought; however, the Spirit himself intercedes for us, in sighs, which can not be uttered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But he who searches the hearts, knows the mind of the Spirit; that, according to the will of God, he makes intercession for the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Besides, we know, that all things work together for good, to them who love God; to them, who are called according to his purpose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For, whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son; that he might be the first born among many brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Moreover, whom he predestinated, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">What shall we say, then, to these things? Since God is for us, who can be against us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He, certainly, who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; how will he not, with him, also, graciously give us all things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who will bring an accusation against the elect of God? Is it God who justifies them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Who is he, who condemns them? It is Christ, who died; or rather, who has risen: who also, is at the right hand of God; and who makes intercession for us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">«As it is written,» 'Truly, for thy sake, we are put to death all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Nay, in all these things, we do more than overcome, through him who has loved us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life; neither angels, nor principalities; nor powers; neither things present, nor to come;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">neither height, nor depth; nor any created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">True: by unbelief they were broken off, and you by faith, stand. Be not high-minded, but fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For, if God spared not the natural branches; perhaps, neither will he spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Behold, then, the goodness and severity of God! Toward them who fell, severity: but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise, you also shall be cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And even they, if they continued not in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">I give thanks to my God always in respect of you; on account of the favor of God, which was given to you through Jesus Christ;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by some of the family of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I mention this, that each of you says, I, indeed, am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For, whereas, among you, envying, and strife, and divisions subsist; are you not fleshly, and walk after the manner of men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Besides, while one says, I, indeed, am of Paul; and another, I of Apollos, are you not fleshly?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Now, these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself, and Apollos, for your sakes, that by us you may learn not to esteem teachers above what has been written, that no one of you may, on account of one teacher, be puffed up against another.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now, concerning the things of which you wrote me: It is good for a man not to marry a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Nevertheless, on account of uncleanness, let every man have a wife of his own, and let every woman have her own husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let the husband fulfill his obligations to his wife: and in like manner, also, the wife to the husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The wife has not the command of her own person, but the husband: and in like manner, also, the husband has not the command of his own person, but the wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Deprive not one another, unless, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; and do you come again together, that Satan may not tempt you through your incontinency.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But this which follows I speak as an advice, and not as an injunction,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">that I wish all men to be as I myself am. However, each has a proper gift from God; one, indeed, after this manner, and another after that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I say, to the unmarried men, and to the widows, it is good for them if they can remain even as I do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yet, if they can not live continently, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to be in pain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now, those who have married I charge, (yet not I, but the Lord;) let not a wife depart from her husband:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">but if she even depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband; and a husband must not put away his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the rest I command, not the Lord; if any brother have an infidel wife, who herself is well pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And a woman who has an infidel husband, who himself is well pleased to dwell with her, let her not put him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the infidel husband is sanctified by the wife, and the infidel wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise, certainly, your children were unclean; whereas, indeed, they are holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if the infidel depart, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not in bondage with such; but God has called us to peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For how do you know, O wife! whether you shall save your husband? And how do you know, O husband! whether you shall save your wife?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But as God has distributed to every one, and as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk; and so, in all the congregations, I ordain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Has any circumcised one been called? Let him not be uncircumcised. Has any one been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Let every one remain in the same calling in which he was called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Were you called, being a bondman? Be not careful to be made free. Yet, if you can be made free, prefer it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Are you bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And yet, if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned: nevertheless, affliction in the flesh such shall have; but I spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now, this I say, brethren, the time being short, it remains that both they who have wives, should be as not having wives;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">and they who weep, as not weeping; and they who rejoice, as not rejoicing; and they who buy, as not possessing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">and they who use this world, as not abusing it: for the form of this world passes by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Besides, I would have you without anxious care. The unmarried man anxiously cares for the things of the Lord; how he shall please the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But he who is married, anxiously cares for the things of the world; how he shall please his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">There is the like difference between the wife and the virgin. The unmarried woman anxiously cares for the things of the Lord; that she may be holy, both in body and spirit: but she who is married, anxiously cares for the things of the world; how she shall please her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Now, this I say, for your own benefit; not with a view to lay a snare for you, but for that which is becoming, and best adapted to a steady, uninterrupted adherence to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But if any one thinks he acts improperly toward his virgin, if she be above age, unmarried, and so needs to be married; let him do what she inclines, he does not sin: let such marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But he who stands firm in his heart; not having necessity, and has power concerning his own will; and has determined this in his own heart, to keep his virgin, does well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So, then, even he who gives her in marriage, does well; but he who gives her not in marriage, does better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">A wife is bound, as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she pleases; only in the Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Concerning, then, the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world; and that there is no other God but one.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But meat does not recommend us to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we do not eat, are we the worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nevertheless, take heed, lest, perhaps, this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if any one see you, who have knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, will not the conscience of him that is weak, be encouraged to eat things sacrificed to idols?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and through this, your knowledge, shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">That there may be no schism in the body; but, that the members may have the very same anxious care, one for another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So, whether one member suffer, all the members sympathize; or, one member be honored, all the members rejoice together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now, you are Christ's body, and members in particular.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And these, indeed, God has placed in the congregation: first, Apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; next, powers; then, gifts of healing; helpers, directors, kinds of foreign languages.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Favor to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies, and the God of all consolation!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who comforts us in all out affliction, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any affliction, by the consolation with which they are comforted of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For as the sufferings for Christ abound in us, also, our consolation abounds through Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now, whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort, and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effected by enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And out hope of you is steadfast, knowing that, as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the comfort.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore, brethren, we would not have you ignorant concerning our affliction, which happened to us in Asia; that we were exceedingly pressed above our strength, insomuch as we despaired even of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nay, more, we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For we write no other things to you than what you read, and also acknowledge; and I hope that you will acknowledge, even to the end;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Having, then, purposed this, did I, indeed, use levity? or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh; so that with me there should be yes, yes, and no, no?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But as God is faithful, certainly our word, which was to you, was not yes and no.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Wherefore, I wrote to you this very thing, that, coming, I might not have sorrow from them in whom I ought to rejoice; being firmly persuaded concerning you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For out of much affliction and distress of heart, I wrote to you with many tears; not that you might be made sorry, but that you might know the love which I have most abundantly toward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now, if a certain person has grieved me, he has not grieved me except by a part of you, that I may not lay a load on you all.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore, I beseech you to confirm your love to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For to this end, also, I wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now, to whom you forgive anything, I also forgive: and even I, if I have now forgiven anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes I forgave it, in the person of Christ:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Must we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some, letters of recommendation to you, or letters of recommendation from you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You are out letter, written on our hearts, known and read of all men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For you are plainly declared Christ's letter, ministered by us, written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on fleshly tables of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now we have such confidence through Christ, toward God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">not that we are competent by ourselves to reckon anything as from ourselves: but our competency is from God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who has made us competent ministers of a new institution; not of letter, but of spirit: for the letter kills; but the spirit makes alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if the ministration of death in letters engraved on stone was with glory, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face, which was to be abolished;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">how much rather shall not the ministration of the Spirit be with glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if the ministration of condemnation was glorious, much more does the ministration of justification abound in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For, indeed, that which was glorified, was not glorified, in this respect, by reason of the transcendent glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if that which is abolished was with glory, much more that which continues, is with glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Having, therefore, such confidence, we use great plainness of speech;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and not as Moses, who put a vail upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Indeed, their minds were blinded: for, till this day, the same vail remains in the reading of the Old Institution; it not being discovered that it is abolished in Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For, whether we be beside ourselves, it is for God; or whether we be sober, it is for you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Yes, beyond our expectations; for they first gave themselves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Now as you abound in every gift, (in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us,) I wish that you may abound in this gift also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I speak not this as an injunction, but on account of the diligence of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">To boast, indeed, is not profitable to me; yet I will proceed to visions and revelations of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I knew a man in Christ fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know; God knows:) such a one suddenly conveyed away to the third heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Indeed, I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that he was suddenly conveyed away into paradise, and heard unspeakable things, which are not lawful for man to utter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Concerning such a one I will boast; but concerning myself I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yet if I should incline to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I will speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any one should think concerning me, above what he sees me to be, or what he hears from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Indeed, that I might not be exalted above measure by the transcendency of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Concerning this, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But he said to me, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">My favor is sufficient for you, besides, my power is perfected in weakness:</STYLE> most gladly, therefore, I will boast rather of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may dwell upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Wherefore, I am well pleased with weaknesses, with insults, with necessities, with persecutions, with distresses, for Christ's sake; because when I am weak, then I am strong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Have I become a fool-? You have constrained me to it; for I ought to have been commended by you, because I am in nothing behind the very greatest Apostles, though I am nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Truly the signs of an Apostle were fully wrought among you with all patience, by signs and wonders, and powers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For what is the thing in which you were inferior to other congregations, unless that I myself have not been burdensome to you? Forgive me this injury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, a third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you; because I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yes, I most gladly will spend and be spent for the sake of your souls; even though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Again, do you think that we apologize to you? In the presence of God we speak in Christ, that all these things, beloved, are done for your edification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yet I am afraid, lest, perhaps, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish: and that I shall be found by you, such as you do not wish: -lest, perhaps, there be among you strifes, emulations, wraths, brawlings, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And lest, when I come again, my God may humble me among you; and I shall bewail many, who have formerly sinned, and have not reformed from the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, which they have committed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove yourselves: know you not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I trust that you shall know that we are not disapproved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">However, I pray to God that you do no evil-not that we may appear approved; but that you may do what is good, though, indeed, we should be disapproved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore we rejoice when we are weak, and you are strong: and this, also, we pray for, even your perfection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For this reason, being absent, I write these things, that, when present, I may not act sharply, according to the power which the Lord has give me for edification, and not for destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Finally, brethren, farewell: be perfect: comfort yourselves: mind the same thing: live in peace: and the God of love and peace will be with you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">I wonder that you are so soon removed from him who called you into the favor of Christ, to another gospel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">which is not another: but there are some who trouble you, and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if even we, or an angel from heaven, declare a gospel to you, different from what we have declared to you, let him be accursed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As we said before, so now I say again, if any one declare a gospel to you, different from what you have received, let him be accursed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For do I now conciliate men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now I certify you, brethren, concerning the gospel which was declared by me, that it is not according to men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, except by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You have certainly heard of my behavior formerly in Judaism; that I exceedingly persecuted the congregation of God, and laid it waste;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and made progress in Judaism above many of the same age with myself, in my own nation, being more exceedingly jealous of the traditions of my fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his favor, was pleased</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">to reveal his Son to me, that I might declare the good news concerning him to the Gentiles; immediately I did not consult flesh and blood:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">neither did I go up to Jerusalem, to them who were Apostles before me; but I went away in Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem, to become acquainted with Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I saw no other of the Apostles, except James, the Lord's brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now as to the things which I write to you, behold, God is my witness that I do not falsely affirm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">After that, I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and I was personally unknown to the congregations of Judea which are in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They had only heard that-he who formerly persecuted us, now announces, as glad tidings, the faith which he formerly destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they glorified God on my account.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then, fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas; taking Titus with me also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I went up by revelation; and communicated to them the gospel which I proclaimed to the Gentiles; but privately to them who were of reputation; lest, perhaps, I should run, or had run in vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">However, neither Titus, who was with me, though a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">even on account of the false brethren secretly introduced; (who came in privily to spy out our liberty, which we have by Jesus Christ, that they might bring us into bondage;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">nor did we give place to them by submission, not even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Besides, from them who were of reputation, I received nothing; (whatever they were formerly, is no matter to me: God respects not a man's appearance. For they who were of reputation, communicated nothing to me.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But, on the contrary, perceiving that I was entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, just as Peter was with that of the circumcision;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">(for he who wrought effectually in Peter for the apostleship of the circumcision, also wrought effectually in me for the Gentiles):</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">even James, and Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, having perceived the favor granted to me, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we, indeed, should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">requesting only, that we would remember the poor, which very thing I had also been diligent to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moreover, when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was to be blamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For, before certain persons came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew, and separated himself, being afraid of them of the circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the other Jews also dissembled with them, insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter, before them all-If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of the Gentiles, and not after the manner of the Jews, why do you compel the Gentiles to Judaize?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We, who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">knowing that man is not justified by works of law, but only through the faith of Jesus Christ; even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by works of law; for by works of law no flesh shall be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if seeking to be justified by Christ, even we ourselves are found sinners, is Christ, then, the minister of sin? By no means.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I constitute myself a transgressor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Besides, I, through law, have died to law, that I might live to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I am crucified together with Christ. Nevertheless, I live; yet not longer I, but Christ lives in me: for the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith which is of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I do not set aside the favor of God. For if righteousness is through law, then certainly Christ has died in vain.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">O inconsiderate Galatians! who has deceived you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ crucified, was evidently represented among you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This, only, I wish to learn from you, did you receive the Spirit by works of law, or by obedience of faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Are you so inconsiderate that, having begun in Spirit, you are now made perfect in flesh?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Have you suffered so many things in vain? if, indeed, it is in vain?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He, then, who ministered to you the Spirit, and wrought miracles among you, did he these by works of law, or by a hearing of faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">know, therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">«For the scripture, foreshowing that God would justify the nations by faith, formerly announced the gospel to Abraham, saying,» 'Surely in you shall all the nations be blessed.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Wherefore, they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">«But as many as are of works of law, are under the curse: for it is written,» 'Accursed is every one who continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">«Besides, that by law no one is justified before God is manifest:» 'For the just by faith shall live.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now, the law is not of faith; but he who does these things, shall live by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">«Christ has bought us off from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us: (for it is written,'Accursed is every one who is hanged on a tree':)»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">that the blessing of Abraham might come on the nations through Christ Jesus; and that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: no one sets aside, or alters a man's Will, after it is ratified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">«Now, to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He does not say,» 'And in seeds,' 'as concerning many; but as concerning one person, '«And in your see,» 'who is Christ.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherefore, this I affirm, that the Will which was before ratified by God concerning Christ, the law, which was made four hundred and thirty years after can not annul, so as to abolish the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Besides, if the inheritance be by law, it is no longer by promise. But God bestowed it freely on Abraham by promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Why, then, the law? It was added on account of transgression, till the seed should come to whom it was promised; being ordained by messengers, in the hand of a Mediator;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and the Mediator is not one party; but God is one party.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Is the law, then, contrary to the promise of God? By no means. For if there had been a law given, which was able to make alive, certainly righteousness would have been by law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the scripture has shut up together all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Wherefore, before faith came, we were kept in durance under law, shut up together to the faith, which should afterward be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So that the law has become our instructor to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But faith being come, we are no longer under this instructor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For you are all the sons of God through the faith by Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Besides, as many of you have been immersed into Christ, have put on Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bondman nor freeman, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And if you are Christ's, certainly you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now, I say, as long as the heir is a minor, he differs nothing from a bondman, though he be lord of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For he is under tutors and stewards, until the time before appointed by his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So, also, we, whilst we were minors, were in bondage under the elements of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So that you are no more a bondman, but a son, and if a son, then heir of God through Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But formerly indeed, when you knew not God, you served those, who by nature were not gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But now, having acknowledged God, (or rather, being acknowledged by God,) why do you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which again, a second time, you incline to be in bondage?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You carefully observe days and moons, and seasons and years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I am afraid of you, lest perhaps, I have labored in vain among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Brethren, I pray you, be as I am: for I am you are. You have injured me in nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You know, indeed, that in weakness of the flesh, I declared the gospel to you at first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Yet that trial of mine, which was in my flesh, you did not despise; neither did you reject me, but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What, then, was your happiness! for I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes, and given them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Am I, then, become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They love you ardently, not honorably. Yes, they wish to exclude us, that you may love them ardently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But it is honorable to be ardently in love with a good man at all times, and not merely when I am present with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My little children, for whom I travail in birth again till Christ be formed in you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I could wish, indeed, to be present with you now, and to change my speech; for I am exceedingly in doubt concerning you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me, you who wish to be under the law, do you hear the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For it is written, that Abraham had two sons: one by the bondmaid, and one by the free woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he, indeed, who was of the bondmaid, was begotten according to the flesh; but he who was of the free woman, was through the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Which things are allegorized: for these women are two institutions; the one, indeed, from Mount Sinai, bringing forth children into bondage, which is Hagar,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">(for the name of Hagar denotes Mount Sinai, in Arabia,) and she answers to the present Jerusalem, and is in bondage with her children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the Jerusalem above, is the free woman, who is our mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">«For it is written,» 'Rejoice, O barren woman, who didst not bring forth! Break out and cry, thou who travailest not in birth; for more are the children of the deserted, than of her who had the husband.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">We, therefore, brethren, like Isaac, are children by promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But even as then, he who was begotten according to the flesh, persecuted him who was begotten according to the Spirit: so also now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">«But what says the scripture?» 'Cast out the bondmaid and her son; for the son of the bondmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Well, then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondmaid, but of the free woman.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Stand fast, therefore, in the freedom with which Christ has freed us, and be not again held fast in the yoke of bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Behold, I, Paul, say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I testify, moreover, to every circumcised person, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">You are loosed from Christ, who are justified by the law; you have fallen from favor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But we, through the Spirit, look for the hope of righteousness by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith, which works by love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You did run well: who has hindered you from obeying the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This persuasion comes not from him who called you.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now, the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these. Fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">envying, murders, intoxications, revellings, and such like: concerning which I foretell you now, as I also have foretold, that they who practice these things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, fidelity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">meekness, temperance: against such things there is no law.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">For your remember, brethren, our labor and toil; that laboring night and day; that we might not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You were witnesses, and God, also, in what a holy, and just, and blameless manner, we acted toward you that believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As, also, you know, how we addressed every one of you as a father his own children, exhorting and comforting you;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">but if any widow have children, or grandchildren, let these learn first piously to take care of their own family, and then to requite their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now she who is really a widow, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers, night and day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But she who lives in pleasure, is dead while she lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if any one provide not for his own, and especially those of his own family, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let not a widow be taken into the number under sixty years old, having been the wife of one husband,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">eminent for good works-that she has brought up children, that she has lodged strangers, that she has washed the saints' feet, that she has relieved the afflicted, that she has diligently followed every good work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But the younger widows reject; for when they become impatient of the restraint of Christ, they will wish to marry,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">incurring blame for having violated their former engagement.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And, at the same time, also, they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers, also, and meddlers, speaking things which they ought not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I would, therefore, have young widows to marry, to bear children, to govern the house, to give no occasion to the adversary for reproach;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">But they who will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which plunge men into destruction and perdition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the love of money is the root of all evil, which some, eagerly desiring, have wholly erred from the faith, and pierced themselves all around with many sorrows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore, do you, O man of God! flee these things, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, patience, meekness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Combat the good combat of faith: lay hold on eternal life; to which, also, you have been called, and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">God, who in ancient times, spoke often, and in various ways, to the fathers, by the prophets,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">has, in these last days, spoken to us by a Son, whom he has constituted Lord of all things, by whom, also, he made the universe:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">who, being in effulgence of his glory, and an exact representation of his character, and controlling all things by his own powerful word, after he had, by himself, made expiation for our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">being exalted as far above the angels, as the name he has inherited, is more excellent than theirs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">«For, to which of the angels did he at any time say,'Thou art my Son: today I have begotten thee'? and again,'I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son'?»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">«But when he brings again the First-born into the world, he says,» 'Let all the angels of God worship him.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">«Whereas, concerning angels, he says,» 'Who makes winds his angels, and flaming fire his ministers.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">«But to the Son,» 'Thy throne, O God, endures for ever. The scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of rectitude.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">«Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore, God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness, above thy associates.»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">«And,» 'Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.'</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">(On this account, we ought to attend the more earnestly to the things which were heard; lest at any time we should left them slip.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if the word spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received a just retribution;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? which, beginning to be spoken by the Lord, was confirmed to us by them who heard him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God, also, bearing witness, both by signs and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to his own pleasure.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover, he has not subjected to the angels the world to come, of which we are speaking.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">but we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, that he, by the favor of God, might taste death for all; for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, to make him, who leads many sons to glory-even the Captain of their Salvation-perfect through sufferings.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">and deliver them, who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For, indeed, he has not at all assumed the nature of angels; but he has assumed the seed of Abraham.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Indeed, he has been accounted worthy of glory, as far superior to Moses, as that of the builder is superior to the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now every house is built by some one; but he, the builder of all things, is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Moses, indeed, as a servant, was faithful in all his house, for a testimony of the things that were to be spoken by him;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Brethren, take heed, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, by departing from the living God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">«with this saying,» 'Today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the bitter provocation.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For some, when they heard, did bitterly provoke; yet, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest, but to them who did not believe?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So, we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Wherefore, let us be afraid, lest a promise of entrance into the rest, being left, any of you should seem to fall short of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For glad tidings have been proclaimed to us, as well as to them: but the word which they heard did not profit them; not being mixed with faith in them who heard it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">«For we, who have believed, do enter into the rest, as he said,'So, I swore, in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest'; namely, from the works that were finished at the formation of the world.»</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Since, then, it remains for some to enter into it, and that they who first received the good tidings, did not enter in on account of unbelief:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">«again, he limits a certain day, saying, by David,» 'Today,' 'after so long a time; as it is said, '«Today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.»</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">There remains, therefore, a divine rest for the people of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he who has entered into his rest, has himself, also, rested from his own works, like as God, also, rested from his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Wherefore let us carefully strive to enter into THIS REST, lest any one should fall after the same example of unbelief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and purposes of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there is no creature concealed from his sight, for all things are naked and open to the eyes of him, to whom we must give an account.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now, having a great High Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we have not a High Priest who can not sympathize with our weaknesses; but one who was tried in all points, according to the likeness of his nature to our ours, without sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let us, therefore, approach, with boldness, to the throne of favor, that we may receive mercy, and obtain favor for the purpose of seasonable help.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For every high priest taken from among men, is appointed to perform for men the things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">being able to have a right measure of compassion on the ignorant and erring: because he himself, also, is surrounded with infirmity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And for that reason he must, as for the people, so, also, for himself, offer sacrifices for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now, as no one takes this honor to himself, but he who is called of God, as Aaron was;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">«so, also, Christ did not assume to himself the honor of being a High Priest: but he who said to him,'Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee'-»</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">He, (who, in the days of his flesh, having, with loud cries, and with tears, offered up prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death, and was delivered from his fear,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">though being a Son, learned obedience by the things which he suffered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and being made perfect, became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">being proclaimed by God a High Priest forever, after the order of Melchisedec:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">(concerning whom we have much to say, and of difficult interpretation, since you have become dull of apprehension.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For, when, by this time, you ought to be teachers, you have need of some one to teach you again the first elements of the oracles of God; and have become such as need milk, rather than solid food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now every one who uses milk, is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">but solid food is for those of a mature age, whose faculties have been habituated by long practice to discriminate both good and evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Wherefore, leaving the first principles of Christian doctrine, let us progress toward maturity, not laying again the foundation concerning reformation from dead works, and faith toward God-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">concerning the doctrine of immersions, and of imposition of hands, of a resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">for this we will do, if God permit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible to renew again to reformation those who have been once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age which was to come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and yet have fallen away, crucifying again to themselves the Son of God and exposing him to contempt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the land that drinks in the rain, which often comes upon it, and brings forth herbs, fit for them by whom it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">But, beloved, we hope better things of you, even things which are connected with salvation, though we thus speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For God is not unrighteous, to forget your work, and the love which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yet, we earnestly desire every one of you to show the same diligence, in order to the realizing of this hope, to the end-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that you may not be slothful, but imitators of them who, through faith and patience, are inheriting the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">«saying,'Surely, blessing, I will bless you, and multiplying, I will multiply you';»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For men, indeed, swear by the greater; and an oath for confirmation is, to them, an end of all contradiction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, God, willing more abundantly to show to their heirs of promise the immutability of his purpose, confirmed it with an oath;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that, by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled away to lay hold on the hope set before us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">which we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and entering into the place within the vail,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">where a forerunner has entered on our account; even Jesus, made a High Priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.)</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchisedec-king of Salem, Priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to whom Abraham imparted even a tenth of all; being, indeed, by interpretation, first, king of righteousness, and next, also, king of Salem; which, by interpretation, is king of peace-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">was without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginnings of days, nor end of life: but, being made like the Son of God, he remains a priest continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now, consider how great this priest was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For they, indeed, of the sons of Levi, who received the priesthood, have a commandment to tithe people according to the law; that is, their brethren, although they have come forth from the loins of Abraham:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">but he, who did not derive his pedigree from their progenitors, tithed Abraham, and blessed the holder of the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now, beyond all contradiction, the less is blessed by the greater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Besides, here, indeed, men, who die, take tithes; but there one, of whom it is testified that he lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And, as one may say, even Levi, who receives tithes, was tithed in Abraham:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moreover, if, indeed, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood, (for with it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should arise, according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be called according to the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Wherefore, the priesthood being changed, there is, of necessity, a change also of law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he to whom these things are said, was of a different tribe, of which no one gave attendance at the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is very plain that our Lord had sprung from Judah, in relation to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Moreover, it is still more plain that, according to the similitude of Melchisedec,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">another priest arises, who is made, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">«For he testifies,» 'Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Here then, there is a disannulling of the preceding commandment, because of its weakness and unprofitableness-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(for the law made no one perfect) -and the superinduction of a better hope, by which we draw near to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Moreover, inasmuch as not without an oath-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">«(for they, indeed, were make priests without an oath, but he, with an oath, by him who said to him,'The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec,')»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">by so much was Jesus made the surety of a better institution.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Besides, many, indeed, are made priests, because by death they are hindered from continuing:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but he, because he lives for ever, has a priesthood which does not pass from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Hence, also, he is for able to save them who come to God through him; always living to make intercession for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now such a High Priest became us; who, being holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">has not, like the high priests, need, from time to time, to offer sacrifices, first for his own sins, then for those of the people; for this latter he did once, when he offered himself up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the law constitutes men high priests, who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, constituted the Son, who is perfected for evermore.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such a High Priest, who has taken his seat at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">a minister of the holy places; namely, of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For every high priest is constituted to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Hence, it was necessary that this High Priest, also, should have something he might offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For, indeed, if he were on earth, he could not be a priest, there being priests who offer gifts according to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">«(These perform divine service for an example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses, when about to construct the tabernacle, was admonished of God:'See, now (says he,) that you make all things according to the type that was showed you in the Mount.')»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Besides, he has now obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as he is the mediator of a better institution, which has been established upon better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first institution had been faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">«But, finding fault, he says to them,» 'Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will make a new institution with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:'</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">not according to the institution which I made with their fathers, at the time of my taking them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt-because they did not abide in my institution, I also neglected them, says the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now this is the institution which I will make with the house of Israel, after these days, says the Lord. I will put my laws into their mind, and inscribe them on their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">«Because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.»</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">«By saying,» 'a new institution,' 'he has made the former old: now, that which is decaying and growing old, is ready to vanish away.'</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now, indeed, the first institution had both ordinances of service, and a worldly holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the first tabernacle, which is called holy, was set in order; in which were both the candlestick and the table, and the showbread;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and behind the second vail, the tabernacle which is called most holy-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">having the golden censer, and the ark of the institution, covered everywhere with gold, in which were the golden pot having the manna, and the rod of Aaron, which budded, and the tables of the institution;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and above it, the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercy-seat; concerning which things we can not at present speak particularly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now, these things being this set in order, the priests go at all times indeed into the first tabernacle, performing the services;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but into the second tabernacle-the high priest alone-once every year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Holy Spirit signifying this, that the way of the holy places was not yet laid open, while the first tabernacle was yet standing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">which was a figurative representation for the time being, during which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which can not, with respect to the conscience, make him who does the service perfect-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">only with meats and drinks, and divers immersions- ordinances concerning the flesh, imposed till the time of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Christ being come-a High Priest of the good things to come-has, through a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, (that is to say, not of this building,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">entered once into the holy places, having obtained eternal redemption; not indeed, by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the polluted, sanctified to the cleansing of the flesh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">how much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through an Eternal Spirit, offered himself without fault, to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And, for this reason, he is mediator of the new institution, that, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first institution, those who had been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now, where there is such an institution, the death of the instituted sacrifice must necessarily intervene:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for since the institution is ratified over the dead, it has no force while the instituted sacrifice lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Hence, neither was the first introduced without blood;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">«for» 'when Moses had spoken every precept in the law to all the people, taking the blood of calves, and of goats, with water and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself, and the people:'</VERS>
