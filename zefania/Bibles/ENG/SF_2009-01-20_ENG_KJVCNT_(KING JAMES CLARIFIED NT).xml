    <description>[King James Bible, Clarified (KJC) NT (v1.0),] April 25, 1998.

  Introduction To Version 1.0, April 25, 1998

   This Bible is theologically identical to the authoritative King James
   Bible (KJV), but it is easier to understand because the language has
   been somewhat updated to reflect current usage.
   
   As its legal creator and owner, I hereby place this revision of the
   King James Bible, New Testament, into the Public Domain. You may use
   it any way you wish.
   
   May the Lord bless this new expression of His holy Word.
   

       Prayer For Blessing Of This Work

       O Lord, please give Your blessing to this work,
       And send it forth from here to do Your will.
       In Jesus' holy name I pray, Amen.


       Command To Ban All Unclean Spirits

       In the name of Jesus Christ, and by His power given to me
       according to Scripture, I hereby command all unclean spirits,
       including Satan and all his workers, to stay far away from
       this presentation of God's holy Word. You may not meddle or
       interfere in any way with this communication of His to His
       people, mankind.

       In Jesus' holy name I issue this command.

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Abraham begot Isaac; and Isaac begot Jacob; and Jacob begot Judas and his brothers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Judas begot Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begot Esrom; and Esrom begot Aram;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Aram begot Aminadab; and Aminadab begot Naasson; and Naasson begot Salmon;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Salmon begot Booz of Rachab; and Booz begot Obed of Ruth; and Obed begot Jesse;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jesse begot David the king; and David the king begot Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Solomon begot Roboam; and Roboam begot Abia; and Abia begot Asa;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Asa begot Josaphat; and Josaphat begot Joram; and Joram begot Ozias;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Ozias begot Joatham; and Joatham begot Achaz; and Achaz begot Ezekias;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Ezekias begot Manasses; and Manasses begot Amon; and Amon begot Josias;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Josias begot Jechonias and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begot Salathiel; and Salathiel begot Zorobabel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Zorobabel begot Abiud; and Abiud begot Eliakim; and Eliakim begot Azor;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Azor begot Sadoc; and Sadoc begot Achim; and Achim begot Eliud;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Eliud begot Eleazar; and Eleazar begot Matthan; and Matthan begot Jacob;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, you son of David, fear not to take unto you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And you Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, are not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of you shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when they had come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be you there until I bring you word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders of it, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go to there: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he came and dwelled in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And saying, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the same John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about the Jordan,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And were baptized of him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Bring forth therefore fruits fit for repentance:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with fire:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and you come to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Jesus answering said unto him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Permit it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness.</STYLE> Then he permitted him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward hungry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he answered and said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the devil takes him up into the holy city, and sets him on a pinnacle of the temple,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And says unto him, If you be the Son of God, cast yourself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning you: and in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jesus said unto him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">It is written again, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Again, the devil takes him up into an exceedingly high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And says unto him, All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then says Jesus unto him, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Get you hence, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the devil left him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he says unto them, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they directly left their nets, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with different diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were insane, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond the Jordan.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">
        <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</STYLE>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And the governor said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see you to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then he released Barabbas unto them: and after Jesus was whipped, he delivered him to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And after they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own clothing on him, and led him away to crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they had come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">And sitting down they watched him there;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="61">And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulcher.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Command therefore that the sepulcher be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said unto them, You have a watch: go your way, make it as secure as you can.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And there appeared unto them cloven tongues just as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when this was reported abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because every man heard them speak in his own language.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And how hear we every man in our own tongue, in which we were born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, You men of Judaea, and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as you yourselves also know:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For David speaks concerning him, I saw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you permit your Holy One to see corruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">You have made known to me the ways of life; you shall make me full of joy with your countenance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Men and brothers, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He seeing this before spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This Jesus has God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he says himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit you on my right hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Until I make your foes your footstool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brothers, what shall we do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, just as many as the LORD our God shall call.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their food with gladness and singleness of heart,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And now, brothers, I know that through ignorance you did it, as did also your rulers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he has so fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Repent you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brothers, like unto me; him shall you hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in your seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And as they spoke unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Howbeit many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it came to pass on the next day, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have you done this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the sick man, by what means he is made whole;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him does this man stand here before you whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This is the stone which was set at no value of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But that it spread no further among the people, let us strictly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was showed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Who by the mouth of your servant David have said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For of a truth against your holy child Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto your servants, that with all boldness they may speak your word,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">By stretching forth your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of your holy child Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that anything of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Whiles it remained, was it not your own? and after it was sold, was it not in your own power? why have you conceived this thing in your heart? you have not lied unto men, but unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Peter said unto her, How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and shall carry you out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then fell she down immediately at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And of the rest no man dared join himself to them: but the people magnified them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing outside before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Saying, Did not we strictly command you that you should not teach in this name? and, behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And said unto them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away many people after him: he also perished; and all, just as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore, brothers, select among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the apostles and brothers that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Upon the which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brothers unto the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brothers unto the grace of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Which was well reported of by the brothers that were at Lystra and Iconium.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After they had come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit permitted them not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was accustomed to be made; and we sat down, and spoke unto the women which resorted to there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Youratira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she was baptized, and her household, she asked us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates tore off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm: for we are all here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out secretly? no truthfully; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they came and sought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brothers, they comforted them, and departed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brothers unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come to here also;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming to there went into the synagogue of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came to there also, and stirred up the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof you speak, is?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For you bring certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, You men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God that made the world and all things in it, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by are and man's device.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance unto all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again of this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Paul departed from among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Silas and Timotheus had come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his clothing, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean; from now on I will go unto the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he departed from there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">
        <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">For I am with you, and no man shall set on you to hurt you: for I have many people in this city.</STYLE>
      </VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Saying, This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look you to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he drove them from the judgment seat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">This man was instructed on the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brothers wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper borders came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He said unto them, Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said unto them, Unto what then were you baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said Paul, John truthfully baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And all the men were about twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when different were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelled in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over those who had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you know that by this craft we have our wealth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Moreover you see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples did not permit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theater.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part did not know why they were come together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense unto the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when the town clerk had appeased the people, he said, You men of Ephesus, what man is there that knows not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For you have brought to here these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Therefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them plead with one another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But if you inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">These going before tarried for us at Troas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the next day; and continued his speech until midnight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go on foot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And we sailed from there, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And when they had come to him, he said unto them, You know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what you are doing: for this man is a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, are you a Roman? He said, yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite you, you whited wall: for do you sit to judge me after the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they that stood by said, Do you revile God's high priest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said Paul, I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest: for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, <STYLE css="color:#FF0000">Be of good cheer, Paul: for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome.</STYLE></VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore you with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you tomorrow, as though you would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he has a certain thing to tell him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto you, who has something to say unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside secretly, and asked him, What is that you have to tell me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire you that you would bring down Paul tomorrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But do not you yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See you tell no man that you have showed these things to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he wrote a letter after this manner:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sends greeting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when I would have known the cause why they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Whom I perceived to be accused by questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when it was told me that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent immediately to you, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before you what they had against him. Farewell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">On the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">I will hear you, said he, when your accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by you we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by your providence,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto you, I pray you that you would hear us of your clemency a few words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who also has gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Commanding his accusers to come unto you: by examining of whom yourself may take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Since as I know that you have been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Because that you may understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But this I confess unto you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Who ought to have been here before you, and object, if they had ought against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Unless it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the last of your matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: therefore he sent for him the more often, and communed with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And desired favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait on the way to kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly to there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Do you want go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as you very well know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Have you appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shall you go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore, when they had come to here, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, you shall hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And on the next day, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not also to signify the crimes laid against him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before you touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Especially because I know you to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: therefore I beseech you to hear me patiently.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I truthfully thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I punished them often in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and those who journeyed with me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">For the king knows of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost you persuade me to be a Christian.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the borders of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously treated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when we had launched from there, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce had come over against Cnidus, the wind not permitting us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; close whereunto was the city of Lasea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart from there also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is a haven of Crete, and lies toward the south west and north west.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing from there, they sailed close by Crete.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, struck sail, and so were driven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, you should have harkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God has given you all them that sail with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be just as it was told me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under color as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship, you cannot be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And while the day was coming on, Paul asked them all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Therefore I pray you to take some food: for this is for your health: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when it was day, they did not know the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="28">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet vengeance did not permit to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Who also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And from there we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Where we found brothers, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And from there, when the brothers heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they had come together, he said unto them, Men and brothers, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning you, neither any of the brothers that came showed or spoke any harm of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and not perceive:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Paul dwelled two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Much every way: chiefly, because unto them were committed the oracles of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">What then? are we better than they? No, in no way: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Now we know that what things soever the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of no effect:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded unto many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Do you not know, brothers, (for I speak to them that know the law,) that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the woman which has a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So then if, while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Therefore, my brothers, you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead in which we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of desire. For without the law sin was dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, You are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Isaiah also cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And as Isaiah said before, Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">As it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stumblingstone and rock of offense: and whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But what says it? The word is close you, even in your mouth, and in your heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For the scripture says, Whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And how shall they preach, unless they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But I say, Have they not heard? yes truthfully, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Isaiah is very bold, and says, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Lord, they have killed your prophets, and dug down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But what says the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If by any means I may provoke to emulation those who are my flesh, and might save some of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Boast not against the branches. But if you boast, you do not bear the root, but the root bears you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You will say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Be not high minded, but fear:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise you also shall be cut off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For if you wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been his counselor?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That in everything you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Just as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God is faithful, by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For it has been declared unto me of you, my brothers, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now this I say, that each of you says, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For after in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom did not know God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But unto those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For you see your calling, brothers, that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">That no flesh should glory in his presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">That, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But as it is written, eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Ghost teaches; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But he that is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And I, brothers, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, just as unto babes in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I have fed you with milk, and not with food: for until now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For while one says, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are you not carnal?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, just as the Lord gave to every man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So then neither is he that plants any thing, neither he that waters; but God that gives the increase.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now he that plants and he that waters are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For we are laborers together with God: you are God's husbandry, you are God's building.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">If any man's work abide which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yes, I judge not my own self.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges me is the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For who makes you to differ from another? and what have you that you did not receive? now if you did receive it, why do you glory, as if you had not received it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are despised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And labor, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we tolerate it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore I beseech you, be followers of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of those who are puffed up, but the power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">What will you? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I truthfully, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">To deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Your glorying is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no not to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For what have I to do to judge them also that are outside? do not you judge them that are within?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But them that are outside God judges. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do you not know that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brothers?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because you go to law one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? why do you not rather permit yourselves to be defrauded?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">No, you do wrong, and defraud, and that your brothers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">What? do you not know that he which is joined to a harlot is one body? for two, says he, shall be one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body; but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">What? do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now concerning the things whereof you wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The wife has not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband has not power of his own body, but the wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Defraud you not one the other, unless it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your lack of self control.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For I would that all men were just as I myself. But every man has his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide just as I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the woman which has a husband that believes not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For what know you, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? or how know you, O man, whether you shall save your wife?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Are you called being a servant? care not for it: but if you may be made free, use it rather.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">You are bought with a price; be not you the servants of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Brethren, let every man, in which he is called, in it abide with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Are you bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But and if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">But if any man think that he behaves himself improperly toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sins not: let them marry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Nevertheless he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">So then he that gives her in marriage does well; but he that gives her not in marriage does better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And if any man think that he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But if any man love God, the same is known of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But food commends us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if any man see you who have knowledge sit at food in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And through your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But when you sin so against the brothers, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore, if food make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For he has put all things under his feet. But when he says all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantages it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">You fool, that which you sow is not given life, unless it die:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And that which you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but bore grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But God gives it a body as it has pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differs from another star in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a life-giving spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">But thanks be to God, which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, by the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effective in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For we would not, brothers, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conduct in the world, and more abundantly toward you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For we write none other things unto you, than what you read or acknowledge; and I trust you shall acknowledge even to the end;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">As also you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that you might have a second benefit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and no no?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But as God is true, our word toward you was not yes and no.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now he which establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So that contrariwise you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore I beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">To whom you forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now thanks be unto God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Since as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But if the ministration of death, written and engraved in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remains is glorious.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the LORD.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of those who believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So then death works in us, but life in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceedingly and eternal weight of glory;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now he that has wrought us for the very same thing is God, who also has given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yes, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things have become new.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle has made you sorry, though it were but for a season.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world works death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For behold this very same thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge! In all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more we rejoiced for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, while he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover, brothers, we do you to know of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For to their power, I bear record, yes, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore, as you abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that you abound in this grace also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which you have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and not according to that he has not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For I mean not that other men be eased, and you burdened:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore show you to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">yet have I sent the brothers, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, you may be ready:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof you had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But this I say, He which sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Every man according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">(As it is written, He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor: his righteousness remains forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Being enriched in everything to all bountifulness, which causes through us thanksgiving to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceedingly grace of God in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Do you look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let such a one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God has distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Would to God you could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his trickery, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For if he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit, which you have not received, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you might well bear with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For you tolerate fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For you suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Of such a one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I hold back, lest any man should think of me above that which he sees me to be, or that he hears of me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For it is written, Rejoice, you barren that bear not; break forth and cry, you that travail not: for the desolate has many more children than she which has a husband.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">God, who at various times and in different manners spoke in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Has in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For unto which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And again, when he brings in the firstbegotten into the world, he says, And let all the angels of God worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And of the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But unto the Son he says, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">They shall perish; but you remain; and they all shall wax old as does a garment;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And as a vesture shall you fold them up, and they shall be changed: but you are the same, and your years shall not fail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with different miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For unto the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Since the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For truthfully he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore in all things it was proper for him to be made like unto his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has builded the house has more honor than the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Moses truthfully was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore (as the Holy Ghost says, Today if you will hear his voice,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">While it is said, Today if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter in it, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David, Today, after so long a time; as it is said, Today if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted just as we are, yet without sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And no man takes this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest; but he that said unto him, You are my Son, today have I begotten you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As he says also in another place, You are a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Called of God a high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and have become such as have need of milk, and not of strong food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For every one that uses milk is unskillfully in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But strong food belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this will we do, if God permit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth herbs suitable for them by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But that which bears thorns and briers is rejected, and is close unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">That you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For men truthfully swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made a high priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abides a priest continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And truthfully they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And as I may so say, Levi also, who receives tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there arises another priest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he testifies, You are a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there is truthfully a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw close unto God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec:)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they truly were many priests, because they were not permitted to continue by reason of death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But this man, because he continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For such a high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For the law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: therefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, says he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For finding fault with them, he says, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, says the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In that he says, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and grows old is ready to vanish away.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then truthfully the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there was a tabernacle made; the first, in which was the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, in which was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Which stood only in foods and drinks, and different washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God has enjoined unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you have had no pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin you would not, neither had pleasure in it; which are offered by the law;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said he, Lo, I come to do your will, O God. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From now on expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And having a high priest over the house of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">He that looked down upon Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs unto me, I will recompense, says the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Partly, while you were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, while you became companions of them that were so used.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For you had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the plundering of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For by it the elders obtained a good report.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing to where he went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from where they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly: therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall your seed be called:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">For whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chastens not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if you be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are you bastards, and not sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them respect: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For they truthfully for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto those who are exercised thereby.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">According as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness love.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are in it shall be burned up.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him has written unto you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">You therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things before, beware lest you also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen.</VERS>
