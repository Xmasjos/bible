    <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <VERS vnumber="2">When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue; and the people, as they listened, were deeply impressed. “Where did he get this?” they said, “and what is this wisdom that has been given him? And these miracles which he is doing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Is not he the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And are not his sisters, too, living here among us?” This proved a hindrance to their believing in him;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Jesus is ‘the stone which, scorned by you the builders, has yet become the corner stone.’</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="31">When their prayer was ended, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to tell God’s message fearlessly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The whole body of those who had become believers in Christ were of one heart and mind. Not one of them claimed any of his goods as his own, but everything was held for the common use.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">The consequence was that people would bring out their sick even into the streets, and lay them on mattresses and mats, in the hope that, as Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on some one of them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">About this time, when the number of the disciples was constantly increasing, complaints were made by the Greek speaking Jews against the Aramaic speaking Jews, that their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Twelve, therefore, called together the general body of the disciples and said to them: “It is not well for us to see to the distribution at the tables and neglect God’s message.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">while we, for our part, will devote ourselves to prayer, and to the delivery of the message.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">This proposal was unanimously agreed to; and the disciples chose Stephen — a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit — and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas of Antioch, a former convert to Judaism;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the high priest asked: “Is this true?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Stephen replied: “Brothers and fathers, hear what I have to say. God, who manifests himself in the glory, appeared to our ancestor Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, and before he settled in Haran, and said to him —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">‘Leave your country and your kindred, and come into the country that I will show you.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And so Abraham left the country of the Chaldaeans and settled in Haran; and from there, after his father’s death, God caused him to migrate into this country, in which you are now living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God did not at that time give him any part of it, not even a foot of ground. But he promised to ‘give him possession of it and his descendants after him, though at that time he had no child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">God’s words were these — ‘Abraham’s descendants will live in a foreign country, where they will be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But I myself will judge the nation, to which they will be enslaved,’ God said, ‘and after that they will leave the country and worship me in this place.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then God made with Abraham the covenant of circumcision; and under it Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him when he was eight days old; and Isaac became the father of Jacob; and Jacob of the Twelve Patriarchs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The Patriarchs, out of jealousy, sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt; but God was with him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and delivered him out of all his troubles, and enabled him to win favor and show wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him Governor of Egypt and of his whole household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then a famine spread over the whole of Egypt and Canaan, causing great distress, and our ancestors could find no food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Hearing, however, that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob sent our ancestors there on their first visit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In the course of their second visit, Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and his family became known to Pharaoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Joseph sent an urgent invitation to his father Jacob and to his relations, seventy-five persons in all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and so Jacob went down into Egypt. There he died, and our ancestors also,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and their bodies were removed to Shechem, and laid in the tomb which Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">As the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people increased largely in numbers in Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">until a new king, who knew nothing of Joseph, came to the throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This king acted deceitfully towards our race and ill-treated our ancestors, making them abandon their own infants, so that they should not be reared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">It was just at this time that Moses was born. He was an exceedingly beautiful child, and for three months was brought up in his own father’s house;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and, when he was abandoned, the daughter of Pharaoh found him and brought him up as her own son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and proved his ability both by his words and actions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">When he was in his fortieth year, he resolved to visit his fellow Israelites;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and, seeing an Israelite ill-treated, he defended him, and avenged the man, who was being wronged, by striking down the Egyptian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He thought his own people would understand that God was using him to save them; but they failed to do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The next day he again appeared on the scene, when some of them were fighting, and tried to make peace between them. ‘Men,’ he said, ‘you are brothers; how is it that you are ill-treating one another?’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But the man who was ill-treating his fellow workman pushed Moses aside saying — ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Do you mean to make away with me as you did yesterday with that Egyptian?’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">At these words Moses took to flight, and became an exile in Midian; and there he had two sons born to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Forty years had passed when there appeared to him, in the desert of Mount Sinai, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">When Moses saw it, he was astonished at the vision; but on his going nearer to look at it more closely, the voice of the Lord was heard to say —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">‘I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses trembled, and did not dare to look.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then the Lord said to him — ‘Take your sandals off your feet, for the spot where you are standing is holy ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">I have seen the oppression of my people who are in Egypt, and heard their groans, and I have come down to deliver them. Come now and I will send you into Egypt.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">This same Moses, whom they had disowned with the words — ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’ was the man whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer, under the guidance of the angel that had appeared to him in the bush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He it was who led them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the desert during forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">This was the Moses who said to the people of Israel — ‘God will raise up for you, from among yourselves, a prophet, as he raised up me.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He, too, it was who was present at the assembly in the desert, with the angel who talked to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors, and who received living truths to impart to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Yet our ancestors refused him obedience; more than that, they rejected him, and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">That was the time when they made the calf and offered sacrifice to their idol, and held festivities in honor of their own handiwork!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">So God turned from them and left them to the worship of the Starry Host, as is written in the book of the prophets —  ‘Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me, house of Israel,All those forty years in the desert?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="44">Our ancestors had the tent where they worshipped God in the desert, constructed, just as he who spoke to Moses had directed him to make it, after the model which he had seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">This tent, which was handed down to them, was brought into this country by our ancestors who accompanied Joshua (at the conquest of the nations that God drove out before their advance), and remained here until the time of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">David found favor with God, and prayed that he might provide the God of Jacob with a place to reside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">But it was Solomon who built a house for God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Yet it is not in buildings made by hands that the Most High dwells. As the prophet says —</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">As a consequence, many of them became believers in Christ, besides a considerable number of Greek women of position, and of men also.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Among others, some Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers joined issue with him. Some asked “What is this prater wanting to make out?”, while others said “He seems to be a preacher of foreign Deities.” (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So they laid hold of him and took him to the Court of Areopagus. crosswire  amateurish codings “May we hear,” they asked, “what new teaching this is which you are giving?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore, as the offspring of God, we must not think that the Deity has any resemblance to anything made of gold, or silver, or stone — a work of human art and imagination.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">True, God looked with indulgence on the days of people’s ignorance, but now he is announcing to everyone everywhere the need for repentance,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">As soon as he said this, a dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and there was a sharp division of opinion among those present.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">So a great uproar ensued, and some of the Teaches of the law belonging to the Pharisees’ party stood up and hotly protested: “We find nothing whatever wrong in this man. Suppose a spirit did speak to him, or an angel...”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The dispute was becoming so violent, that the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces between them, ordered the Guard to go down and rescue him from them, and take him into the Fort.  crosswire  amateurish codings</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">That night the Lord came and stood by Paul, and said:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">The commanding officer then dismissed the lad, cautioning him not to mention to anybody that he had given him that information.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Five days afterwards the high priest Ananias came down with some of the councillors and a barrister named Tertullus. They laid an information with the Governor against Paul;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">“We owe it to your Excellency,” he said, “that we are enjoying profound peace, and we owe it to your foresight that this nation is constantly securing reforms — advantages which we very gratefully accept at all times and places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But — not to be tedious — I beg you, with your accustomed fairness, to listen to a brief statement of our case.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">The Jewish crowd also joined in the attack and bore out his statements.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On a sign from the Governor, Paul made this reply: crosswire  amateurish codings “Knowing, as I do, for how many years you have acted as judge to this nation, it is with confidence that I undertake my own defense.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">This, however, I do acknowledge to you, that it is as a believer in the cause which they call heretical, that I worship the God of my ancestors. At the same time, I believe everything that is in accordance with the law and that is written in the prophets;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">After some years’ absence I had come to bring charitable gifts to my nation, and to make offerings;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and it was while engaged in this that they found me in the Temple, after completing a period of purification, but not with any crowd or disorder.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Through him we received the gift of the apostolic office, to win submission to the faith among all nations for the glory of his name.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">I want you to know, my friends, that I have many times intended coming to see you — but until now I have been prevented — that I might find among you some fruit of my labors, as I have already among the other nations.</VERS>

And it was as a sign of this that he received the rite of circumcision — to show the righteousness due to the faith of an uncircumcised man — in order that he might be the father of all who have faith in God even when uncircumcised, so that they also may be regarded by God as righteous;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">That is why everything is made to depend on faith: so that everything may be God’s gift, and in order that the fulfillment of the promise may be made certain for all Abraham’s descendants — not only for those who take their stand on the law, but also for those who take their stand on the faith of Abraham. (He is the Father of us all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">as scripture says — ‘I have made you the Father of many nations.’) And this they do in the sight of that God in whom Abraham had faith, and who gives life to the dead, and speaks of what does not yet exist as if it did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">With no ground for hope, Abraham, sustained by hope, put faith in God; in order that, in fulfillment of the words — ‘So many will your descendants be,’ he might become ‘the Father of many nations.’</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">To the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been consecrated by union with Christ Jesus and called to become his people, and also to all, wherever they may be, who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ — their Master and ours,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">from Paul, who has been called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and from Sosthenes, our fellow follower of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.  crosswire  amateurish codings</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I always thank God about you for the blessing bestowed on you in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For through union with him you were enriched in every way — in your power to preach, and in your knowledge of the truth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and so became yourselves a confirmation of my testimony to the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There is no gift in which you are deficient, while waiting for the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God himself will strengthen you to the end, so that at the day of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be found blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">God will not fail you, and it is he who called you into communion with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But I appeal to you, my friends, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree in what you profess, and not to allow divisions to exist among you, but to be united — of one mind and of one opinion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For I have been informed, my friends, by the members of Chloe’s household, that party feeling exists among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I mean this: that every one of you says either ‘I follow Paul,’ or ‘I Apollos,’ or ‘I Cephas,’ or ‘I Christ.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You have torn the Christ in pieces! Was it Paul who was crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the faith of Paul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">so that no one can say that you were baptized into my faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I baptized also the household of Stephanas. I do not know that I baptized anyone else.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">My mission from Christ was not to baptize, but to tell the good news; not, however, in the language of philosophy, in case the cross of the Christ should be robbed of its meaning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The message of the cross is indeed mere folly to those who are in the path to ruin, but to us who are in the path of salvation it is the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For scripture says —  ‘I will bring the philosophy of the philosophers to nought, and the shrewdness of the shrewd I will bring to nothing.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Where is the philosopher? Where the teacher of the law? Where the disputant of today? Has not God shown the world’s philosophy to be folly?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For since the world, in God’s wisdom, did not by its philosophy learn to know God, God saw fit, by the ‘folly’ of our proclamation, to save those who believe in Christ!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">While Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks study philosophy,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">we are proclaiming Christ crucified! — to the Jews an obstacle, to the Gentiles mere folly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">but to those who have received the call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For God’s ‘folly’ is wiser than people, and God’s ‘weakness’ is stronger than people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Look at the facts of your call, friends. There are not many among you who are wise, as people reckon wisdom, not many who are influential, not many who are high-born;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">but God chose what the world counts foolish to put its wise to shame, and God chose what the world counts weak to put its strong to shame,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">and God chose what the world counts poor and insignificant — things that to it are unreal — to bring its ‘realities’ to nothing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">so that in his presence no one should boast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But you, by your union with Christ Jesus, belong to God; and Christ, by God’s will, became not only our wisdom, but also our righteousness, holiness, and deliverance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">so that — in the words of scripture —  ‘Let him who boasts make his boast of the Lord!’ crosswire  amateurish codings</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">For my own part, friends, when I came to you, it was with no display of eloquence or philosophy that I came to tell the hidden purpose of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">for I had determined that, while with you, I would forget everything Jesus Christ — and him crucified!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Indeed, when I came among you, I was weak, and full of fears, and in great anxiety.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">My message and my proclamation were not delivered in the persuasive language of philosophy, but were accompanied by the manifestation of spiritual power,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">so that your faith should be based, not on the human wisdom, but on the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yet there is a philosophy that we teach to those whose faith is matured, but it is not the philosophy of today, or of the leaders of today — whose downfall is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">No, it is a divine philosophy that we teach, one concerned with the hidden purpose of God — that long hidden philosophy which God, before time began, destined for our glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This philosophy is not known to any of the leaders of today; for, had they known it, they would not have crucified our glorified Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It is what scripture speaks of as —  ‘What eye never saw, nor ear ever heard,what never entered people's minds —even all that God has prepared for those who love him.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yet to us God revealed it through his Spirit; for the Spirit fathoms all things, even the inmost depths of God’s being.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For what person is there who knows what a person is, except the person’s own spirit within them? So, also, no one comprehends what God is, except the Spirit of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And as for us, it is not the spirit of the world that we have received, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we may realize the blessings given to us by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And we speak of these gifts, not in language taught by human philosophy, but in language taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things in spiritual words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The merely intellectual person rejects the teaching of the Spirit of God; for to them it is mere folly; they cannot grasp it, because it is to be understood only by spiritual insight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the person with spiritual insight is able to understand everything, although they themselves are understood by no one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For ‘who has so comprehended the mind of the Lord as to be able to instruct him?’ We, however, have the mind of Christ.  crosswire  amateurish codings</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters, counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In this the person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will receive their own reward in proportion to their own labor.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Let people look on us as Christ’s servants, and as stewards of the hidden truths of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now what we look for in stewards is that they should be trustworthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But it weighs very little with me that I am judged by you or by any human tribunal. No, I do not even judge myself;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">for, though I am conscious of nothing against myself, that does not prove me innocent. It is the Lord who is my judge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore do not pass judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes. He will throw light on what is now dark and obscure, and will reveal the motives in people’s minds; and then everyone will receive due praise from God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">All this, friends, I have, for your sakes, applied to Apollos and myself, so that, from our example, you may learn to observe the precept — ‘Keep to what is written,’ that none of you may speak boastfully of one teacher to the disparagement of another.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Instead of grieving over it and taking steps for the expulsion of the man who has done this thing, is it possible that you are still puffed up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I myself, though absent in body, have been present with you in spirit, and in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already passed judgment, just as if I had been present, on the man who has acted in this way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I have decided — having been present in spirit at your meetings, when the power of the Lord Jesus was with us —</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Still, it is not everyone that has this knowledge. Some people, because of their association with idols, continued down to the present time, eat the food as food offered to an idol; and their consciences, while still weak, are dulled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">What we eat, however, will not bring us nearer to God. We lose nothing by not eating this food, and we gain nothing by eating it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But take care that this right of yours does not become in any way a stumbling-block to the weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if some one should see you who possess this knowledge, feasting in an idol’s temple, will not their conscience, if they are weak, become so hardened that they, too, will eat food offered to idols?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And so, through this knowledge of yours, the weak person is ruined — someone for whose sake Christ died!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">In this way, by sinning against your fellow followers of the Lord and injuring their consciences, while still weak, you sin against Christ.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Next, friends, I would like to remind you of the good news which I told you, and which you received — the good news on which you have taken your stand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and by means of which you are being saved. I would like to remind you of the words that I used in telling it to you, since you are still holding fast to it, and since it was not in vain that you became believers in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For at the very beginning of my teaching I gave you the account which I had myself received — that Christ died for our sins (as the scriptures had foretold),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">that he was buried, that on the third day he was raised (as the scriptures had foretold),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of his followers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have gone to their rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After that, he appeared to James, and then to all the apostles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Last of all, he appeared even to me, who am, as it were, the abortion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For I am the meanest of the apostles, I who am unworthy of the name of ‘apostle,’ because I persecuted the church of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But it is through the love of God that I am what I am, and the love that he showed me has not been wasted. No, I have toiled harder than any of them, and yet it was not I, but the love of God working with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Whether, then, it was I or whether it was they, this we proclaim, and this you believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now, if it is proclaimed of Christ that he has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But, if there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then even Christ has not been raised;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and, if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without meaning, and our faith without meaning also!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yes, and we are being proved to have borne false testimony about God; for we testified of God that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead do not rise!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For, if the dead do not rise, then even Christ himself has not been raised,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">and, if Christ has not been raised, your faith is folly — your sins are on you still!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yes, and they, who have passed to their rest in union with Christ, perished!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If all that we have done has been to place our hope in Christ for this life, then we of all people are the most to be pitied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But, in truth, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of those who are at rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For, since through a man there is death, so, too, through a man there is a resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For, as through union with Adam all die, so through union with the Christ will all be made to live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But each in their proper order — Christ the first-fruits; afterwards, at his coming, those who belong to the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then will come the end — when he surrenders the kingdom to his God and Father, having overthrown all other rule and all other authority and power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For he must reign until God ‘has put all his enemies under his feet.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The last enemy to be overthrown is death;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">Again, what good will they be doing who are baptized on behalf of the dead? If it is true that the dead do not rise, why are people baptized on their behalf?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Why, too, do we risk our lives every hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Daily I face death — I swear it, friends, by the pride in you that I feel through my union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">If with only human hopes I had fought in the arena at Ephesus, what should I have gained by it? If the dead do not rise, then — ‘Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die’!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Do not be deceived.  ‘Good character is marred by evil company.’</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="38">God gives it the body that he pleases — to each seed its special body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">All forms of life are not the same; there is one for people, another for beasts, another for birds, and another for fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">There are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the beauty of the heavenly bodies is not the beauty of the earthly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">There is a beauty of the sun, and a beauty of the moon, and a beauty of the stars; for even star differs from star in beauty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. Sown a mortal body, it rises immortal; sown disfigured, it rises beautiful;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">sown weak, it rises strong; sown a human body, it rises a spiritual body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">As surely as there is a human body, there is also a spiritual body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">That is what is meant by the words — ‘Adam, the first man, became a human being’; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">That which comes first is not the spiritual, but the human; afterwards comes the spiritual;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="49">And as we have borne the likeness of him who came from the dust, so let us bear the likeness of him who came from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">This I say, friends — Flesh and blood can have no share in the kingdom of God, nor can the perishable share the imperishable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Listen, I will tell you God’s hidden purpose! We will not all have passed to our rest, but we will all be transformed — in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">at the last trumpet-call; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise immortal, and we, also, will be transformed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">For this perishable body of ours must put on an imperishable form, and this dying body a deathless form.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And, when this dying body has put on its deathless form, then indeed will the words of scripture come true —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">‘death has been swallowed up in victory! Where, Death, is your victory? Where, death, is your sting?’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">It is sin that gives death its sting, and it is the law that gives sin its power.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-merciful Father, the God ever ready to console,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">It is true that we have our full share of the sufferings of the Christ, but through the Christ we have also our full share of consolation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If we meet with trouble, it is for the sake of your consolation and salvation; and, if we find consolation, it is for the sake of the consolation that you will experience when you are called to endure the sufferings that we ourselves are enduring;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and our hope for you remains unshaken. We know that, as you are sharing our sufferings, you will also share our consolation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">We want you, friends, to know that, in the troubles which befell us in Roman Asia, we were burdened altogether beyond our strength, so much so that we even despaired of life.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And from so imminent a death God delivered us, and will deliver us again; for in him we have placed our hopes of future deliverance, while you, also, help us by your prayers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">To the churches in Galatia, from Paul, an apostle whose commission is not from any human authority and is given, not by human beings, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and from all the followers of the Lord here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, bless you and give you peace. For Christ, to rescue us from this present wicked age,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">to whom be ascribed all glory for ever and ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I am astonished at your so soon deserting him, who called you through the love of Christ, for a different ‘good news,’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Which is really no good news at all. But then, I know that there are people who are harassing you, and who want to pervert the good news of the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yet even if we — or if an angel from heaven were to tell you any other ‘good news’ than that which we told you, may he be accursed!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">We have said it before, and I repeat it now — If anyone tells you a ‘good news’ other than that which you received, may he be accursed!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Is this, I ask, trying to conciliate people, or God? Am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I should not be a servant of Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I remind you, friends, that the good news which I told is no mere human invention.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I, at least, did not receive it from any human being, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through a revelation made by Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">You heard, no doubt, of my conduct when I was devoted to Judaism — how I persecuted the church of God to an extent beyond belief, and made havoc of it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and how, in my devotion to Judaism, I surpassed many of my contemporaries among my own people in my intense earnestness in upholding the traditions of my ancestors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But when God, who had set me apart even before my birth, and who called me by his love,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">saw fit to reveal his Son in me, so that I might tell the good news of him among the Gentiles, then at once, instead of consulting any human being,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">or even going up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, I went to Arabia, and came back again to Damascus.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">I did not, however, see any other apostle, except James, the Master’s brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">(As to what I am now writing to you, I call God to witness that I am speaking the truth).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Afterwards I went to the districts of Syria and Cilicia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But I was still unknown even by sight to the Christian churches in Judea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">all that they had heard was — ‘The man who once persecuted us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once made havoc.’</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Fourteen years afterwards I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas, and I took Titus also with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">It was in obedience to a revelation that I went; and I laid before the apostles the good news that I am proclaiming among the Gentiles. I did this privately before those who are thought highly of because I was afraid that I might possibly be taking, or might have already taken, a course which would prove useless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yet even my companion, Titus, though a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But, because of those who pretended to be followers who had stolen in, the intruders who had crept in to spy on the liberty which we have through union with Christ Jesus, in order to bring us back to slavery —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Why, we did not for a moment yield submission to them, so that the truth of the good news might be yours always!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Of those who are thought somewhat highly of — what they once were makes no difference to me; God does not recognize human distinctions — those, I say, who are thought highly of added nothing to my message.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the good news for the Gentiles, just as Peter had been for the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For he who gave Peter power for his mission to the Jews gave me, also, power to go to the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Recognizing the charge entrusted to me, James, Peter, and John, who were regarded as pillars of the church, openly acknowledged Barnabas and me as fellow workers, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Only we were to remember the poor — the thing I was myself anxious to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But, when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face; for he stood self-condemned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Before certain persons came from James, he had been in the habit of eating with the Gentile converts; but, when they came, he began to withdraw and hold aloof, because he was afraid of offending those who still held to circumcision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The rest of the Jewish converts were guilty of the same hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led away by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But, when I saw that they were not dealing straightforwardly with the truth of the good news, I said to Peter, before them all, “If you, who were born a Jew, adopt Gentile customs, instead of Jewish, why are you trying to compel the Gentile converts to adopt Jewish customs?”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">We, though we are Jews by birth and not outcasts of Gentile origin, know that no one is pronounced righteous as the result of obedience to law, but only through faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So we placed our faith in Christ Jesus, in order that we might be pronounced righteous, as the result of faith in Christ, and not of obedience to law; for such obedience ‘will not result in even one soul’s being pronounced righteous.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">If, while seeking to be pronounced righteous through union with Christ, we were ourselves seen to be outcasts, would that make Christ an agent of sin? Heaven forbid!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For, if I rebuild the things that I pulled down, I prove myself to have done wrong.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">I, indeed, through law became dead to law, in order to live for God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">I have been crucified with Christ. So it is no longer I that live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and, as for my present earthly life, I am living it by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I do not reject the love of God. If righteousness comes through law, then there was no need for Christ to die!</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Foolish Galatians! Who has been fascinating you — you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was depicted on the cross?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Here is the one thing that I want to find out from you — Did you receive the Spirit as the result of obedience to law, or of your having listened with faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Can you be so foolish? After beginning with what is spiritual, do you now end with what is external?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Did you go through so much to no purpose? — if indeed it really was to no purpose!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He who supplies you abundantly with his Spirit and endows you with such powers — does he do this as the result of obedience to law? Or as the result of your having listened with faith?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">It is just as it was with Abraham —  ‘He had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You see, then, that those whose lives are based on faith are the sons of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And scripture, foreseeing that God would pronounce the Gentiles righteous as the result of faith, foretold the good news to Abraham in the words —  ‘Through you all the Gentiles will be blessed.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And, therefore, those whose lives are based on faith share the blessings bestowed on the faith of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">All who rely on obedience to law are under a curse, for scripture says —  ‘Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all that is written in the book of the law, and do it.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Again, it is evident that no one is pronounced righteous before God through law, for we read —  ‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the law is not based on faith; no, its words are —  ‘Those who practice these precepts will find life through them.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Christ ransomed us from the curse pronounced in the law, by taking the curse on himself for us, for scripture says —  ‘Cursed is anyone who is hanged on a tree.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And this he did that the blessing given to Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through their union with Jesus Christ; that so, through our faith, we also might receive the promised gift of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">To take an illustration, friends, from daily life — No one sets aside even an agreement between two people, when once it has been confirmed, nor do they add conditions to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now it was to Abraham that the promises were made, ‘and to his offspring.’ It was not said ‘to his offsprings,’ as if many persons were meant, but the words were ‘to your offspring,’ showing that one person was meant — and that was Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">My point is this — An agreement already confirmed by God cannot be canceled by the law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to cause the promise to be set aside.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">If our heritage is the result of law, then it has ceased to be the result of a promise. Yet God conferred it on Abraham by a promise.  crosswire  amateurish codings</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">What, then, you ask, was the use of the law? It was a later addition, to make people conscious of their wrong-doings, and intended to last only until the coming of that ‘offspring’ to whom the promise had been made; and it was delivered through angels by a mediator.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now mediation implies more than one person, but God is one only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Does that set the law in opposition to God’s promises? Heaven forbid! For, if a law had been given capable of bestowing life, then righteousness would have actually owed its existence to law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the words of scripture represent the whole world as being in bondage to sin, so that the promised blessing, dependent, as it is, on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who have faith in him.  crosswire  amateurish codings</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Before the coming of faith, we were kept under the guard of the law, in bondage, awaiting the faith that was destined to be revealed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Thus the law has proved a guide to lead us to Christ, in order that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But now that faith has come we no longer need a guide.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For you are all sons of God, through your faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For all of you who were baptized into union with Christ clothed yourselves with Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">All distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, have vanished; for in union with Christ Jesus you are all one.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">My point is this — As long as the heir is under age, there is no difference between him and a slave, though he is master of the whole estate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He is subject to the control of guardians and stewards, during the period for which his father has power to appoint them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And so is it with us; when we were under age, as it were, we were slaves to the puerile teaching of this world;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but, when the full time came, God sent his Son — born a woman’s child, born subject to law —</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And it is because you are sons that God sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son, with the cry — ‘Abba, our Father.’</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">You remember that it was owing to bodily infirmity that on the first occasion I told you the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And as for what must have tried you in my condition, it did not inspire you with scorn or disgust, but you welcomed me as if I had been an angel of God — or Christ Jesus himself!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What has become then, of your blessings? For I can bear witness that, had it been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Am I to think, then, that I have become your enemy by telling you the truth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Certain people are seeking your favor, but with no honorable object. No, indeed, they want to isolate you, so that you will have to seek their favor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">It is always honorable to have your favor sought in an honorable cause, and not only when I am with you, my dear children —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">You for whom I am again enduring a mother’s pains, until a likeness to Christ will have been formed in you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But I could wish to be with you now and speak in a different tone, for I am perplexed about you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Tell me, you who want to be still subject to law — Why do not you listen to the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">scripture says that Abraham had two sons, one the child of the slave-woman and the other the child of the free woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the child of the slave-woman was born in the course of nature, while the child of the free woman was born in fulfillment of a promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This story may be taken as an allegory. The women stand for two Covenants. One covenant, given from Mount Sinai, produces a race of slaves and is represented by Hagar</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">(The word Hagar meaning in Arabia Mount Sinai) and it ranks with the Jerusalem of today, for she and her children are in slavery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But the Jerusalem above is free, and she it is who is our mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">For scripture says —  ‘Rejoice, you barren one, who does never bear,Break into shouts, you who are never in labor,For many are the children of her who is desolate —aye, more than of her who has a husband.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As for ourselves, friends, we, like Isaac, are children born in fulfillment of a promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Yet at that time the child born in the course of nature persecuted the child born by the power of the Spirit; and it is the same now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But what does the passage of scripture say?  ‘Send away the slave-woman and her son; for the slave’s son will not be coheir with the son of the free woman.’</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">For we, by the help of the Spirit, are eagerly waiting for the fulfillment of our hope — that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If we are in union with Christ Jesus, neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything, but faith, working through love, is everything.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">To Christ’s people at Ephesus who are faithful to him, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord, who has blessed us on high with every spiritual blessing, in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For he chose us in our union with Christ before the creation of the universe, so that we might be holy and blameless in his sight, living in the spirit of love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">From the first he destined us, in his goodwill towards us, to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and so to enhance that glorious manifestation of his loving kindness which he gave us in the one he loves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">for in him, and through the shedding of his blood, we have found redemption in the pardon of our offenses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All this accords with the loving kindness which God lavished on us, accompanied by countless gifts of wisdom and discernment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">when he made known to us his hidden purpose. And it also accords with the goodwill which God purposed to exhibit in Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">in view of that divine order which was to mark the completion of the ages, when he should make everything, both in heaven and on earth, centre in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In him, I say, for by our union with him we became God’s heritage, having from the first been destined for this in the intention of him who, in all that happens, is carrying out his own fixed purpose;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">that we should enhance his glory — we who have been the first to rest our hopes on the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And you, too, by your union with him, after you had heard the message of the truth, the good news of your salvation — you believed in him and were sealed as his by receiving the holy Spirit, which he had promised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Spirit is a pledge of our future heritage, foreshadowing the full redemption of God’s own people — to enhance his glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And therefore I, ever since I heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which prevails among you, and of your confidence in all Christ’s people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">have never omitted to thank God on your behalf, whenever I make mention of you in my prayers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">My prayer is that the God of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-glorious Father, may inspire you with wisdom and true insight through a fuller knowledge of himself;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">that your minds may be so enlightened that you may realize the hope given by God’s call, the wealth of the glory of his heritage among Christ’s people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and the transcendent greatness of the power which he is able to exercise in dealing with us who believe in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The same mighty power was exerted on the Christ, when he raised the Christ from the dead and ‘caused him to sit at his right hand’ on high, exalting him above all angels and archangels of every rank,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and above every name that can be named, whether in the present age, or in the age to come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And God placed ‘all things under Christ’s feet,’ and gave him to the church as its supreme head;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">for the church is Christ’s body, and is filled by him who fills all things everywhere with his presence.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">You yourselves were once dead because of your offenses and sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For at one time you lived in sin, following the ways of the world, in subjection to the Ruler of the powers of the air — the Spirit who is still at work among the disobedient.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And it was among them that we all once lived our lives, indulging the cravings of our earthly nature, and carrying out the desires prompted by that earthly nature and by our own thoughts. Our nature exposed us to the divine wrath, like the rest of humanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yet God, in his abundant compassion, and because of the great love with which he loved us,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">even though we were ‘dead’ because of our offenses, gave life to us in giving life to the Christ. (By God’s loving kindness you have been saved.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And, through our union with Christ Jesus, God raised us with him, and caused us to sit with him on high,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">in order that, by his goodness to us in Christ Jesus, he might display in the ages to come the boundless wealth of his loving kindness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For it is by God’s loving kindness that you have been saved, through your faith. It is not due to yourselves; the gift is God’s.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">It is not due to obedience to law, so that no one can boast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For we are God’s handiwork, created, by our union with Christ Jesus, for the good actions in doing which God had pre-arranged that we should spend our lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Remember, therefore, that you were once Gentiles yourselves, as your bodies showed; you were called ‘The Uncircumcised’ by those who were called ‘The Circumcised’ — circumcised only by human hands!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Remember that you were at that time far from Christ; you were shut out from the citizenship of Israel; you were strangers to the Covenants founded on God’s Promise; you were in the world without hope and without God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But now, through your union with Christ Jesus, you who once were ‘far off’ have, by the shedding of the blood of the Christ, been brought ‘near.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He it is who is our peace. He made the two divisions of humanity one, broke down the barrier that separated them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and in his human nature put an end to the cause of enmity between them — the law with its injunctions and ordinances — in order to create, through union with himself, from Jew and Gentile, one new humanity and so make peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when, on the cross, he had destroyed their mutual enmity, he sought by means of his cross to reconcile them both to God, united in one body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He came with the good news of peace for you who were ‘far off,’ and of peace for those who were ‘near’;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">for it is through him that we, the Jews and the Gentiles, united in the one Spirit, are now able to approach the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">It follows, then, that you are no longer strangers and aliens, but are fellow citizens with Christ’s people and members of God’s Household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">You have been built up on the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being ‘the corner-stone.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">United in him, every part of the building, closely joined together, will grow into a Temple, consecrated by its union with the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And, through union in him, you also are being built up together, to be a place where God lives through the Spirit.  crosswire  amateurish codings</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus, the Christ, for the sake of you Gentiles —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For you have heard, I suppose, of the responsible charge with which God entrusted me for your benefit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and also that it was by direct revelation that the hidden purpose of God was made known to me, as I have already briefly told you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And, by reading what I have written, you will be able to judge how far I understand this hidden purpose of God in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">In former generations it was not made known to humanity, as fully as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to the apostles and prophets among Christ’s people —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That, by union with Christ Jesus and through the good news, the Gentiles are coheirs with us and members of one body, and that they share with us in God’s Promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Of this good news I became a minister, in virtue of the charge with which God entrusted me in the exercise of his power —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yes, to me, who am less than the least of all Christ’s people, was this charge entrusted! — to tell the Gentiles the good news of the boundless wealth to be found in the Christ,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and to make clear what is God’s way of working out that hidden purpose which from the first has been concealed in the mind of the Creator of all things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">so that now to the archangels and to all the powers on high should be made known, through the church, the all-embracing wisdom of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">in accordance with that purpose which runs through all the ages and which he has now accomplished in Jesus, the Christ, our Master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And in union with him, and through our trust in him, we find courage to approach God with confidence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore I beg you not to be disheartened at the sufferings that I am undergoing for your sakes; for they redound to your honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For this reason, then, I kneel before the Father —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">From whom all ‘fatherhood’ in heaven and on earth derives its name —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And pray that, in proportion to the wealth of his glory, he will strengthen you with his power by breathing his Spirit into your inmost soul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">so that the Christ, through your faith, may make his home within your hearts in love; And I pray that you, now firmly rooted and established, may, with all Christ’s people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">have the power to comprehend in all its width and length and height and depth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and to understand — though it surpasses all understanding — the love of the Christ; and so be filled to the full with God himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">To him who, through his power which is at work within us, is able to do far more than anything that we can ask or conceive —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">To him be all glory through the church and through Christ Jesus, for all generations, age after age. Amen.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I beg you, then — I who am a prisoner in the Master’s cause — to live lives worthy of the call that you have received;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">always humble and gentle, patient, bearing lovingly with one another,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and striving to maintain in the bond of peace the unity given by the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There is but one body and one Spirit, just as there was but one hope set before you when you received your call.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There is but one Lord, one faith, one baptism.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There is but one God and Father of all — the God who is over all, pervades all, and is in all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Everyone of us, however, has been entrusted with some charge, each in accordance with the extent of the gift of the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That is why it is said —  ‘When he went up on high, he led his captives into captivity. And gave gifts to humanity.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now surely this ‘going up’ must imply that he had already gone down into the world beneath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He who went down is the same as he who went up — up beyond the highest heaven, so that he might fill all things with his presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he it is who gave to the church apostles, prophets, Missionaries, Pastors, and teachers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">to fit his people for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And this will continue, until we all attain to that unity which is given by faith and by a fuller knowledge of the Son of God; until we reach maturity — the full standard of the perfection of the Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then we will no longer be like infants, tossed backward and forward, blown about by every breath of human teaching and by people's trickery and craftiness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">but holding the truth in a spirit of love, we will grow into complete union with him who is our head — Christ himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For from him the whole body, closely joined and knit together by the contact of every part with the source of its life, derives its power to grow, in proportion to the vigour of each individual part; and so is being built up in a spirit of love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">This, then, as one in union with the Lord, I implore: Do not continue to live such purposeless lives as the Gentiles live,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">with their powers of discernment darkened, cut off from the life of God, owing to the ignorance that prevails among them and to the hardness of their hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Lost to all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to licentiousness, in order to practice every kind of impurity without restraint.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But far different is the lesson you learned from the Christ — if, that is, you really listened to him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and through union with him were taught the truth, as it is to be found in Jesus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For you learned with regard to your former way of living that you must cast off your old nature, which, yielding to deluding passions, grows corrupt;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">that the spirit of your minds must be constantly renewed;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and that you must clothe yourselves in that new nature which was created to resemble God, with the righteousness and holiness springing from the truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Since, therefore, you have cast off what is false, ‘you must every one of you speak the truth to your neighbors.’ For we are united to one another like the parts of a body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">‘Be angry, yet do not sin.’ Do not let the sun go down on your anger;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and give no opportunity to the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Let the person who steals steal no longer, but rather let them toil with their hands at honest work, so that they may have something to share with anyone in need.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Never let any foul word pass your lips, but only such good words as the occasion demands, so that they may be a help to those who hear them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And do not grieve God’s Holy Spirit; for it was through that Spirit that God sealed you as his, against the day of Redemption.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Let all bitterness, passion, anger, brawling, and abusive language be banished from among you, as well as all malice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, ready to forgive one another, just as God, in Christ, forgave you.  crosswire  amateurish codings</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore imitate God, as his dear children,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">and live a life of love, following the example of the Christ, who loved you and gave himself for you as ‘an offering and a sacrifice to God, that should be fragrant and acceptable.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">As for sexual immorality and every kind of impurity, or greed, do not let them even be mentioned among you, as befits Christ’s people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">nor shameful conduct, nor foolish talk or jesting, for they are wholly out of place among you; but rather thanksgiving.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For of this you may be sure — that no one who is unchaste or impure or greedy of gain (for to be greedy of gain is idolatry) has any place awaiting him in the kingdom of the Christ and God.  crosswire  amateurish codings</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">For, although you were once in darkness, now, by your union with the Lord, you are in the light. Live as ‘children of light’ —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For the outcome of life in the light may be seen in every form of goodness, righteousness, and sincerity —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Always trying to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Take no part in deeds of darkness, from which no good can come; on the contrary, expose them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It is degrading even to speak of the things continually done by them in secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">All such actions, when exposed, have their true character made manifest by the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For everything that has its true character made manifest is clear as light. And that is why it is said —  ‘Sleeper, awake!Arise from the dead,And the Christ will give you light!’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Take great care, then, how you live — not unwisely but wisely,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">making the most of every opportunity; for these are evil days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore do not grow thoughtless, but try to understand what the Lord’s will is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Do not drink wine to excess, for that leads to profligacy; but seek to be filled with the Spirit of God, and speak to one another in psalms and hymns and sacred songs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Wives should submit to their husbands as submitting to the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For a man is the head of his wife, as the Christ is the head of the church — being indeed himself the Savior of his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But as the church submits to the Christ, so also should wives submit to their husbands in everything.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Husbands, love your wives, just as the Christ loved the church, and gave himself for her,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">to make her holy, after purifying her by the washing with the water, according to his promise;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">so that he might himself bring the church, in all her beauty, into his own presence, with no spot or wrinkle or blemish of any kind, but that she might be holy and faultless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">That is how husbands ought to love their wives — as if they were their own bodies. A man who loves his wife is really loving himself;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">for no one ever yet hated his own body. But everyone feeds his body and cares for it, just as the Christ for the church;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">It has even become evident, not only to all the imperial guard, but to everyone else, that it is for Christ’s sake that I am in chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And besides this, most of our fellow followers have gained confidence in the Lord through my chains, and now venture with far greater freedom to speak of God’s message fearlessly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">It is true that some do proclaim the Christ out of Jealousy and opposition; but there are others who proclaim him from goodwill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The latter do it from love for me, knowing that I have been appointed to plead the cause of the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The former spread the news of the Christ in a factious spirit, and not sincerely, thinking to add to the pain of my chains.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that, through your prayers and through a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, ‘all this will make for my salvation.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And this will fulfill my earnest expectation and hope that I will have no cause for shame, but that, with unfailing courage, now as hitherto, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">for to me life is Christ, and death is gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But what if the life here in the body — if this brings me fruit from my labors? Then which to choose I cannot tell! I am sorely perplexed either way!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">My own desire is to depart and be with Christ, for this would be far better.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But, for your sakes, it may be more needful that I should still remain here in the body.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">To the Thessalonian church in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, from Paul, Silas, and Timothy. May God bless you and give you peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">We always mention you in our prayers and thank God for you all;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">recalling continually before our God and Father the efforts that have resulted from your faith, the toil prompted by your love, and the patient endurance sustained by your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Friends, whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">because the good news that we brought came home to you, not merely as so many words, but with a power and a fulness of conviction due to the Holy Spirit. For you know the life that we lived among you for your good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And you yourselves began to follow, not only our example, but the Master’s also; and, in spite of much suffering, you welcomed the message with a joy inspired by the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and so became a pattern to all who believed in Christ throughout Macedonia and Greece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For it was from you that the Lord’s message resounded throughout Macedonia and Greece; and, more than that, your faith in God has become known far and wide; so that there is no need for us to say another word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Indeed, in speaking about us, the people themselves tell of the reception you gave us, and how, turning to God from your idols, you became servants of the true and living God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and are now awaiting the return from heaven of his Son whom he raised from the dead — Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Yes, friends, you yourselves know that your reception of us was not without result.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For, although we had experienced suffering and ill treatment, as you know, at Philippi, we had the courage, by the help of our God, to tell you God’s good news in spite of great opposition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Our appeal to you was not based on a delusion, nor was it made from unworthy motives, or with any intention of misleading you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But, having been found worthy by God to be entrusted with the good news, therefore we tell it; with a view to please, not people, but God who proves our hearts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Never at any time, as you know, did we use the language of flattery, or make false professions in order to hide selfish aims. God will bear witness to that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Nor did we seek to win honor from people, whether from you or from others, although, as apostles of Christ, we might have burdened you with our support.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But we lived among you with the simplicity of a child; we were like a woman nursing her own children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In our strong affection for you, that seemed to us the best way of sharing with you, not only God’s Good news, but our lives as well — so dear had you become to us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">You will not have forgotten, friends, our labor and toil. Night and day we used to work at our trades, so as not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you God’s good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">You will bear witness, and God also, that our relations with you who believed in Christ were pure, and upright, and beyond reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Indeed, you know that, like a father with his own children, we used to encourage and comfort every one of you, and solemnly plead with you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">so that you should make your daily lives worthy of God who is calling you into the glory of his kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">This, too, is a reason why we, on our part, are continually thanking God — because, in receiving the teaching that you had from us, you accepted it, not as the teaching of humans, but as what it really is — the teaching of God, which is even now doing its work within you who believe in Christ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For you, friends, began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea which are in union with Jesus Christ; you, in your turn, suffering at the hands of your fellow citizens, in the same way as those churches did at the hands of of their people —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us also. They do not try to please God, and they are enemies to all humanity,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">As for ourselves, friends, our having been bereaved of you even for a short time — though in body only, and not in spirit — made us all the more eager to see your faces again; and the longing to do so was strong on us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">That was why we made up our minds to go and see you — at least I, Paul, did, more than once — but Satan put difficulties in our way.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For he is the radiance of the glory of God and the expression of his being, upholding all creation by the power of his word; and, when he had made an expiation for the sins of humanity, he ‘took his seat at the right hand’ of God’s Majesty on high,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And again, when God brought the first-born into the world, he said —  ‘Let all the angels of God bow down before him.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Speaking of the angels, he said —  ‘He makes the winds his angelsAnd the flames of fire his servants’;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Therefore we must give still more heed to what we were taught, so we do not drift away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For, if the message which was delivered by angels had its authority confirmed, so that every offense against it, or neglect of it, met with a fitting requital,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">how can we, of all people, expect to escape, if we disregard so great a salvation? It was the Master who at the outset spoke of this salvation, and its authority was confirmed for us by those who heard him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">while God himself added his testimony to it by signs, and marvels, and many different miracles, as well as by imparting the Holy Spirit as he saw fit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">God has not given to angels the control of that future world of which we are speaking!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">No; a writer has declared somewhere —  ‘What are mere mortals that you should remember them?Or human beings that you should care for them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You have made them, for a while, lower than angels;With glory and honor you have crowned them;You have set them over all that your hands have made;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">You have placed all things beneath their feet.’  This ‘placing of everything’ under humanity means that there was nothing which was not placed under them. As yet, however, we do not see everything placed under humanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and death, crowned with glory and honor; so that his tasting the bitterness of death should, in God’s loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He says —  ‘I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters,In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.’</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of ‘the children,’ Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death — that is, the devil —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but ‘to the help of the descendants of Abraham.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like ‘his brothers and sisters,’ in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity’s relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">While the faithful service of Moses in the whole house of God was that of a servant, whose duty was to bear testimony to a message still to come,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">There is no record of his father, or mother, or lineage, nor again of any beginning of his days, or end of his life. In this he resembles the Son of God, and stands before us as a priest whose priesthood is continuous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Consider, then the importance of this Melchizedek, to whom even the patriarch Abraham himself gave a tithe of the choicest spoils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Those descendants of Levi, who are from time to time appointed to the priesthood, are directed to collect tithes from the people in accordance with the law — that is from their own kindred, although they also are descended from Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Melchizedek, although not of this lineage, received tithes from Abraham, and gave his blessing to the man who had God’s promises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now no one can dispute that it is the superior who blesses the inferior.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In the one case the tithes are received by people who are mortal; in the other case by one about whom there is the statement that his life still continues.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Moreover, in a sense, even Levi, who is the receiver of the tithes, has, through Abraham, paid tithes;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">If, then, perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood — and it was under this priesthood that the people received the law — why was it still necessary that a priest of a different order should appear, a priest of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">With the change of the priesthood a change of the law became a necessity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he of whom all this is said belonged to quite a different tribe, no member of which has ever served at the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For it is plain that our Lord had sprung from the tribe of Judah, though of that tribe Moses said nothing about their being priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">All this becomes even yet plainer when we remember that a new priest has appeared, resembling Melchizedek,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and that he was appointed, not under a law regulating only earthly matters, but by virtue of a life beyond the reach of death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">for that is the meaning of the declaration —  ‘You are for all time a priest of the order of Melchizedek.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">On the one hand, we have the abolition of a previous regulation as being both inefficient and useless</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">(for the law never brought anything to perfection); and, on the other hand, we have the introduction of a better hope, which enables us to draw near to God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then again, the appointment of this new priest was ratified by an oath, which is not so with the Levitical priests,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Again, new Levitical priests are continually being appointed, because death prevents their remaining in office;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Every high priest is appointed for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows, therefore, that this high priest must have some offering to make.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If he were, however, still on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts as the law directs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">(These priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to Moses when he was about to construct the tent. ‘Look to it,’ are the words, ‘that you make every part in accordance with the pattern shown you on the mountain.’)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as far excelling theirs, as the covenant of which he is the intermediary, based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But, finding fault with the people, God says —  ‘“A time is coming,” says the Lord,“When I will ratify a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah —</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Not such a covenant as I made with their ancestorsOn the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.For they did not abide by their covenant with me,And therefore I disregarded them,” says the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">“This is the covenant that I will make with the people of IsraelAfter those days,” says the Lord.“I will impress my laws on their minds,And will inscribe them on their hearts;And I will be their God,And they will be my people.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">It is true that even the first covenant had its regulations for divine worship, and its sanctuary — though only a material one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For a tent was constructed, with an outer part which contained the stand for the lamps, and the table, and the consecrated bread. This is called the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The part of the tent behind the second curtain is called the inner sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">In it is the gold incense-altar, and the ark containing the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark is a gold casket containing the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets on which the covenant was written;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">while above it, and overshadowing the cover on which atonement was made, are the cherubim of the presence. Now is not the time to discuss these things in detail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Such, then, was the arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly going, in the discharge of their sacred duties;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">but into the inner only the high priest goes, and that but once a year, and never without taking the blood of a victim, which he offers on his own behalf, and on behalf of the errors of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">By this the Holy Spirit is teaching that the way into the sanctuary was hidden, as long as the outer part of the tent still remained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For that was only a type, to continue down to the present time; and, in keeping with it, both gifts and sacrifices are offered, though incapable of satisfying the conscience of the worshiper;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">the whole system being concerned only with food and drink and various ablutions — external ceremonials imposed until the coming of the new order.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But, when Christ came, he appeared as high priest of that better system which was established; and he entered through that nobler and more perfect ‘tent,’ not made by human hands — that is to say, not a part of this present creation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Nor was it with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, that he entered, once and for all, into the sanctuary, and obtained our eternal deliverance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For, if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, purify those who have been defiled (as far as ceremonial purification goes),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of the living God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And that is why he is the intermediary of a new covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a deliverance from the offenses committed under the first covenant, those who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Whenever such a covenant as a will is in question, the death of the testator must of necessity be alleged.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For such a covenant takes effect only on death, it does not come into force as long as the testator is alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">This explains why even the first covenant was not ratified without the shedding of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For, when every command had been announced to all the people by Moses in accordance with the law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled even the book of the law, as well as all the people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">saying, as he did so — “This is the blood that renders valid the covenant which God has commanded to be made with you.”</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And in the same way he also sprinkled with the blood the tent and all the things that were used in public worship.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The law, though able to foreshadow the better system which was coming, never had its actual substance. Its priests, with those sacrifices which they offer continuously year after year, can never make those who come to worship perfect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Otherwise, would not the offering of these sacrifices have been abandoned, as the worshipers, having been once purified, would have had their consciences clear from sins?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But, on the contrary, these sacrifices recall their sins to mind year after year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to remove sins.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure, as you advance in the knowledge of God and of Jesus, our Lord.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">For it was through this that he gave us what we prize as the greatest of his promises, that through them you might participate in the divine nature, now that you have fled from the corruption in the world, resulting from human passions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Yes, and for this reason do your best to supplement your faith by goodness, goodness by knowledge,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">knowledge by self-control, self-control by endurance, endurance by piety,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">piety by mutual affection, and mutual affection by love.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Surely the person who has not these virtues is shortsighted even to blindness, and has chosen to forget that they have been purified from their sins of the past!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After this, in my vision, I saw an open door in the heavens, and the first voice that I heard was like the blast of a trumpet speaking to me. It said — ‘Come up here and I will show you what must take place.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Immediately after this I fell into a trance. There stood a throne in heaven, and on the throne was One seated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He who was seated on it was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius; and ‘around the throne there was a rainbow’ of the color of an emerald.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Out from the throne ‘come flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder’! There are seven torches burning in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and in front of the throne is what seemed to be a sea of glass, ‘resembling crystal, while within the space before the throne and around the throne are four Creatures full of eyes’ in front and behind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The first Creature is like a lion, the second Creature like a calf, the third Creature has a face like a man’s, and the fourth Creature is like an eagle on the wing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">These four Creatures have each of them six wings, and all around, and within, they are full of eyes; and day and night they never cease to say —  ‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, our God, the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who will be.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And, whenever these Creatures give praise and honor and thanks to him who is ‘seated on the throne, to him who lives for ever and ever,’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">the twenty-four councillors prostrate themselves before him who is seated on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever, and throw down their crowns before the throne, saying —</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then I saw at the right hand of him who was ‘seated on the throne a book, with writing inside and out, and sealed’ with seven seals;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">But no one either in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or look within it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">At this I wept long, because no one could be found who was worthy to open the book or look within it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But one of the councillors said to me — ‘Do not weep. The Lion conquered — the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Scion of David — and can therefore open the book with its seven seals.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then, within the space between the throne and the four Creatures, and in the midst of the councillors, I saw, standing, a Lamb, which seemed to have been sacrificed. It had seven horns and seven eyes. (These eyes are the seven spirits of God, and they are sent into all the world.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Lamb came forward; and he has taken the book from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And, when he had taken the book, the four Creatures and the twenty-four councillors prostrated themselves before the Lamb, each of them holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense. (These are the prayers of Christ’s people.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they are singing a new song —  ‘You are worthy to take the book and break its seals, for you were sacrificed, and with your blood you did buy for God people of every tribe, and language, and people, and nation,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and did make them a kingdom of priests in the service of our God, and they are reigning on the earth.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then, in my vision, I heard the voices of many angels around the throne, and of the Creatures, and of the councillors. In number they were ‘ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands,’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and they cried in a loud voice —  ‘Worthy is the Lamb that was sacrificed to receive all power, and wealth, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and praise, and blessing.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I heard every created thing in the air, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them crying —  ‘To him who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb be ascribed all blessing, and honor, and praise, and dominion for ever and ever.’</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">He carried me away in a trance to a great high mountain, and showed me Jerusalem, the Holy City, descending out of heaven from God, filled with the glory of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Its brilliance was like a precious stone, like a jasper, transparent as crystal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">It had a great high wall, in which were twelve gates; and at these gates there were twelve angels, and there were names inscribed on the gates, the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">‘There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, on which were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the angel who was speaking to me had as a measure a gold rod, with which to measure the city and its gates and its wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The city is square; the length and the breadth are the same. The angel measured with his rod; it was twelve hundred miles; its length, and breadth, and height are equal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he measured the wall; it was two hundred and eighty-eight feet, as people measure, that is as the angel measured.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The material of the wall of the city was jasper, and the city was built of pure gold, which shone like clear glass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The foundations of the wall of the city were ornamented with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was a jasper; the second a sapphire; the third a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">the fifth a sardonyx; the sixth a carnelian; the seventh a chrysolite; the eighth a beryl; the ninth a topaz; the tenth a chrysoprase; the eleventh a hyacinth; and the twelfth an amethyst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The twelve gates were made of twelve pearls, each gate of one pearl. The street of the city was of pure gold, transparent as glass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And I saw no Temple there, for the Lord, our God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are its Temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The city has no need of ‘the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God illuminated it,’ and its Lamp was the Lamb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">‘The nations walk by the light of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Its gates will never be shut by day,’ and there will be no night there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And people will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">‘Never will any unhallowed thing enter it,’ nor they whose life is shameful and false, but only ‘those whose names have been written in the Lamb’s book of life.’</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the angel showed me ‘a river of the water of life,’ as clear as crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">in the middle of the street of the city. On each side of the river was a Tree of life which bore twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">‘Every thing that is accursed will cease to be.’ The throne of God and of the Lamb will be within it, and his servants will worship him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Night will cease to be. They have no need of the light of a lamp, nor have they the light of the sun; for the ‘Lord God will be their light, and they will reign for ever and ever.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the angel said to me — ‘These words may be trusted and are true. The Lord, the God that inspires the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants what must quickly take place;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and they said Blessed will he be who lays to heart the words of the prophecy contained in this book.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It was I, John, who heard and saw these things; and, when I heard and saw them, I prostrated myself in worship at the feet of the angel that showed them to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But he said to me — ‘Forbear; I am your fellow servant, and the fellow servant of your fellow prophets, and of all who lay to heart the words in this book. Worship God.’  crosswire  amateurish codings</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the angel said to me — ‘Do not keep secret the words of the prophecy contained in this book; for the time is near.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Let the wrong-doer continue to do wrong; the filthy-minded continue to be filthy; the righteous continue to act righteously; and the holy-minded continue to be holy.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Blessed will they be who wash their robes, that they may have the right to approach the Tree of life, and may enter the city by the gates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Outside will be the filthy, the sorcerers, the impure, the murderers, the idolaters, and all who love the false and live it.’  crosswire  amateurish codings</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">‘Come,’ say the Spirit and the Bride; and let him who hears say ‘Come.’ Let him who thirsts come; let him who will take the water of life freely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I declare to all who hear the words of the prophecy contained in this book — ‘If anyone adds to it, God will add to his troubles the curses described in this book;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">and if anyone takes away any of the words in the book containing this prophecy, God will take away his share in the Tree of life, and in the Holy City — as described in this book.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He whose testimony this is says — ‘Amen, come, Lord Jesus.’</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, be with his people.</VERS>
